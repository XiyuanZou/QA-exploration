She had been convicted of the murder of her husband. An exhibition \"Within These Walls\" follows the prison's history from 1299 to 1934. \nThe exhibition was designed and created by Officer Rob Nicholson and officially opened by Lawrence Major, Ethel's grandson.\n\nIn 1976 Hull prison was involved in a three-day riot by inmates of the prison. Over 100 prisoners were involved in a protest that erupted over staff brutality. The riot ended peacefully on 3 September 1976 but over two thirds of the prison was destroyed,\nwith an estimated repair cost of \u00a33 \u2013 \u00a34\u00a0million. The prison was closed for a year while repairs were carried out. Disciplinary proceedings following the riots led to a number of legal challenges.\n\nThe Prison was removed from the high-security estate in 1985 and became a local prison holding inmates remanded and sentenced by courts in the area.\n\nIn 2002 a major expansion was completed making the prison more modern rather than Victorian, which added four new wings, a new gymnasium, a new health care centre and a multi-faith centre.\n\nIn January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that older parts of Hull Prison will close, with a reduction of 282 places at the prison. In April 2014 the Ministry of Justice announced that these would be brought back into use as the \"prison population is currently above published projections\".\n\nAfter rioting at Birmingham Prison in December 2016, some prisoners were transferred from Birmingham to Hull.  Disturbances were reported at HMP Hull.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, Staff at HMP Hull, along with many other prisons across the country, walked out under protest due to health and safety conditions across the prison estate. The protest was amid fears of rising violence, wanting safety improvements and a reduction in violence and overcrowding.\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that HMP Hull will be one of 10 prisons chosen for body scanners which aims to reduce drugs and violence, while improving standards, in the country's most challenging jails providing a template for the wider estate.\n\nIn January 2021, it was reported that HMP Hull had been dealing with a huge COVID-19 outbreak which saw around 80 prisoners and staff struck down by the virus.\n\nThe prison today\nHull is a local prison holding remand, sentenced and convicted males. Prisoners are employed in the workshops, kitchens, gardens and waste management departments. Education classes are also available to prisoners.\n\nHMP Hull houses the Within These Walls exhibition which charts the history of Hull's prisons from 1299 through to the present day. The exhibition was created by officer Rob Nicholson and opened in 2011.",

Operated by His Majesty\u2019s Prison Service, it houses remand, sentenced, and convicted male inmates. Prisoners are engaged in various work assignments, including workshops, kitchens, gardens, and waste management, while educational programs are also available.  \n\n**Historical Background**  \nEstablished in 1870, Hull Prison features a classic Victorian design. One of its most notable historical events was the execution of Ethel Major in 1934\u2014the last person and only woman to be executed at the facility\u2014after she was convicted of murdering her husband. The prison\u2019s rich history, spanning from 1299 to 1934, is documented in the exhibition *\"Within These Walls,\"* curated by Officer Rob Nicholson and officially opened by Ethel\u2019s grandson, Lawrence Major.  \n\n**Key Events and Developments (1934\u2013Present)**  \n1. **1976 Riot**: A three-day uprising, sparked by allegations of staff brutality, resulted in significant destruction. Over 100 prisoners participated, damaging two-thirds of the facility and incurring \u00a33\u20134 million in repairs. The prison closed for a year for reconstruction, followed by disciplinary proceedings and legal challenges.  \n\n2. **1985**: Hull was reclassified from the high-security estate to a local prison, primarily holding remanded and sentenced inmates.  \n\n3. **2002 Expansion**: A major modernization project introduced four new wings, a gymnasium, a healthcare center, and a multi-faith center, shifting the prison away from its Victorian-era infrastructure. While these upgrades likely improved inmate facilities, specific impacts on daily operations remain unspecified.  \n\n4. **2013\u20132014**: Plans to close older sections (reducing capacity by 282 beds) were reversed due to rising prison populations, keeping the additional space operational.  \n\n5. **December 2016**: Following riots at Birmingham Prison, Hull received transferred inmates, leading to reported disturbances.  \n\n6. **14 September 2018**: Staff staged a walkout over unsafe working conditions, citing escalating violence, overcrowding, and demands for better safety protocols.  \n\n7. **January 2019**: Hull was among 10 prisons selected to receive body scanners to combat drug-related violence.  \n\n8. **January 2021**: A significant COVID-19 outbreak affected approximately 80 prisoners and staff.  \n\n9. **Exhibition Update**: The *\"Within These Walls\"* exhibition, launched in 2011, continues to chronicle the prison\u2019s history up to the present day.  \n\n**Current Operations**  \nToday, HMP Hull remains a functional local prison, accommodating remand, sentenced, and convicted males. Inmates participate in vocational work and educational programs, supported by facilities such as workshops, kitchens, and gardens. The 2002 expansion enhanced amenities, though its direct effects on daily routines and living conditions are not detailed in available records.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nFrom its Victorian origins to its modern-day role, HMP Hull has undergone significant transformations. While infrastructure improvements have modernized the facility, challenges such as overcrowding and violence persist, reflecting broader issues within the prison system. The prison\u2019s historical legacy, including its infamous 1976 riot and Ethel Major\u2019s execution, remains a key part of its identity.",

    "document": "Chinook winds, or simply Chinooks, are two types of prevailing warm, generally westerly winds in western North America: Coastal Chinooks and interior Chinooks. The coastal Chinooks are persistent seasonal, wet, southwesterly winds blowing in from the ocean. The interior Chinooks are occasional warm, dry f\u00f6hn winds blowing down the eastern sides of interior mountain ranges. The coastal Chinooks were the original term, used along the northwest coast, and the term in the interior of North America is later and derives from the coastal term.\n Along the Pacific Northwest coast, where the name is pronounced  ('chin'+'uk'), the name refers to wet, warm winds off the ocean from the southwest; this is the original use of the term. The coastal Chinook winds deliver tremendous amounts of moisture both as rain along the coast and snow in the coastal mountains, that sustain the characteristic temperate rainforests and climate of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn North American western interior, the same name is used for f\u00f6hn winds, generally, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains lie immediately east of various interior mountain ranges. There the name is pronounced  ('shin'+'uk'). The same warm, wet coastal winds can also become the warm f\u00f6hn winds on the eastern sides of mountain ranges, after having lost their moisture on the western sides; however, due to expanded use of the term in the interior for any f\u00f6hn wind, interior Chinooks are not necessarily originally coastal Chinooks.\n\nIn the interior of North America, the Blackfoot people call these winds the \"snow eater\"; however, the more commonly used term \"Chinook\" originates from the name of the eponymous Chinook people, who lived near the ocean, along the lower Columbia River, where the term was first derived. The reference to  \"a Chinook\" wind or weather system originally meant, to euro-American settlers along the Pacific Northwest coast, a warming wind from the ocean blowing into the interior regions of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.\n\nA strong f\u00f6hn wind can make snow one foot (30\u00a0cm) deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly sublimates and partly melts and evaporates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to as high as 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F) for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest\n\n\"Chinook\" is used for coastal Chinook winds in British Columbia, and is the original use of the term, being rooted in the lore of coastal natives and immigrants, and brought to Alberta by French-speaking fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest.\nThese same winds have more recently been called the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii.\n\nThe air associated with a coastal Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon; most of the region's stormy winds come when a fast \"westerly\" jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash.\n\nWhen a coastal Chinook comes in when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm coastal Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.\n\nThe effects on the Interior of British Columbia when a coastal Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be wrung out of the rising air as a consequence of crossing over the mountain ramparts before the air mass descends (and hence warms and dries) into the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects are similar to those of an Albertan interior Chinook, though not to the same extreme, partly because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and partly because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the coastal Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.\n\nPronunciation in the Pacific Northwest\nThe word \"Chinook\" remains in common use among local fishermen and people in communities along the British Columbia Coast, and coastal Washington and Oregon, and in particular, the term is used in the Puget Sound area of Washington. Coastal \"Chinook\" is not pronounced shin-uk ()  as it is in the interior, east of the Cascades, but is in the original coastal pronunciation chin-uk ().\n\nIn British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest, the word Chinook was predominantly pronounced  . However, the common pronunciation current throughout most of the inland Pacific Northwest, Alberta, and the rest of Canada, is  , as in French. This difference may be because it was the M\u00e9tis employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were familiar with the Chinook people and country, brought the name east of the Cascades and Rockies, along with their own ethnic pronunciation. Early records are clear that tshinook was the original pronunciation, before the word's transmission east of the Rockies.\n\nFirst nations myth from British Columbia",

This drastically reduces snow cover in a short time.\n\n2. **Temperature Extremes**: These winds can raise winter temperatures dramatically, from below \u221220\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to as high as 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F) for hours or days, followed by a sharp drop back to base temperatures.\n\n3. **Moisture Redistribution**: Coastal Chinooks lose moisture as rain or snow on western mountain slopes, then descend as warm, dry winds on the eastern sides, creating a rain shadow effect in interior regions like the Fraser Canyon and Thompson River-Okanagan area.\n\n4. **Weather Pattern Disruption**: Coastal Chinooks push back cold Arctic air masses, shortening cold spells and snowfalls to a few days, followed by rapid snowmelt. In the interior, this can lead to slushy conditions due to warm spells rather than rain.\n\n5. **Wind Dynamics**: While coastal Chinooks are stable and minimize gusts, they can still bring fresh gales in exposed areas. In contrast, stormy winds in the region typically result from clashes between temperate and subarctic air masses, not Chinooks.\n\nThese mechanisms collectively alter precipitation distribution, snowpack duration, and temperature variability in the interior."

This rapid snow loss occurs through a combination of sublimation, melting, and evaporation driven by the wind\u2019s dry warmth. Chinooks are known to dramatically raise winter temperatures\u2014sometimes from below \u221220\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to as high as 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F)\u2014for several hours or days before temperatures plummet back to their usual lows.  \n\n### Origins of the Name  \nIn the interior of North America, the Blackfoot people refer to these winds as the \"snow eater.\" However, the more widely recognized term \"Chinook\" originates from the Chinook people, who lived near the Pacific Ocean along the lower Columbia River. For Euro-American settlers in the Pacific Northwest, the term initially described a warming ocean wind that blew inland.  \n\nIn the interior regions of western North America\u2014particularly the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains\u2014the same name is applied to f\u00f6hn winds, though the pronunciation shifts to *'shin-uk'* (compared to the coastal *'chin-uk'*). While these interior Chinooks share characteristics with their coastal counterparts, they are not always directly linked to them. Instead, the term has broadened to describe any f\u00f6hn wind in the interior, regardless of its origin.  \n\n### Formation and Effects  \nInterior Chinooks arise when warm, moist coastal winds lose their moisture on the western slopes of mountain ranges. As the air descends the eastern slopes, it warms and dries, creating the occasional f\u00f6hn winds that define the region\u2019s weather patterns. These winds have several notable impacts:  \n\n1. **Rapid Snowmelt**: Strong Chinooks can erase deep snow cover in hours, through both sublimation and melting.  \n2. **Temperature Swings**: Winter temperatures may surge by 30\u201340\u00b0C (54\u201372\u00b0F) for short periods before dropping abruptly.  \n3. **Rain Shadow Effect**: Coastal Chinooks release moisture on western mountain slopes, leaving eastern regions drier and warmer.  \n4. **Disrupted Weather Patterns**: The winds push back Arctic air masses, shortening cold spells and causing rapid snowmelt, often leading to slushy conditions.  \n5. **Wind Behavior**: Coastal Chinooks tend to be stable, while stormy winds in the region usually result from clashes between temperate and subarctic air masses.  \n\n### Key Mechanisms  \nThe Canadian Prairies and Great Plains experience interior Chinooks due to their proximity to mountain ranges. Key processes include:  \n- **Moisture Loss**: Coastal winds shed precipitation on western slopes, becoming dry as they descend eastward.  \n- **Adiabatic Warming**: The descending air heats up, causing sharp temperature spikes.  \n- **Ephemeral Nature**: Unlike coastal Chinooks, interior f\u00f6hn winds are intermittent and not always tied to oceanic systems.  \n\nWhile the document does not detail unique atmospheric pressure systems in the Prairies and Plains, it underscores how topography and wind dynamics shape the region\u2019s climate\u2014transforming winter landscapes in a matter of hours.",

Over time, the term \"Chinook\" has broadened in the interior to describe any f\u00f6hn wind, meaning not all interior Chinooks necessarily begin as coastal Chinooks.  \n\nBy efficiently redistributing heat and moisture, Chinook winds play a remarkable role in shaping local weather patterns, offering temporary respite from harsh winter conditions.",

In flood forecasting, hydrologists may want to know how a short burst of intense rain in an area upstream of a city will change as it reaches the city. Routing can be used to determine whether the pulse of rain reaches the city as a deluge or a trickle.\n\nRouting also can be used to predict the hydrograph shape (and thus lowland flooding potential) subsequent to multiple rainfall events in different sub-catchments of the watershed.  Timing and duration of the rainfall events, as well as factors such as antecedent moisture conditions, overall watershed shape, along with subcatchment-area shapes, land slopes (topography/physiography), geology/hydrogeology (i.e. forests and aquifers can serve as giant sponges that absorb rainfall and slowly release it over subsequent weeks and months), and stream-reach lengths all play a role here.  The result can be an additive effect (i.e. a large flood if each subcatchment's respective hydrograph peak arrives at the watershed mouth at the same point in time, thereby effectively causing a \"stacking\" of the hydrograph peaks), or a more distributed-in-time effect (i.e. a lengthy but relatively modest flood, effectively attenuated in time, as the individual subcatchment peaks arrive at the mouth of the main watershed channel in orderly succession).\n\nOther uses of routing include reservoir and channel design, floodplain studies and watershed simulations.\n\nIf the water flow at a particular point, A, in a stream is measured over time with a flow gauge, this information can be used to create a hydrograph. A short period of intense rain, normally called a flood event, can cause a bulge in the graph, as the increased water travels down the river, reaches the flow gauge at A, and passes along it. If another flow gauge at B, downstream of A is set up, one would expect the graph's bulge (or floodwave) to have the same shape. However, the shape of the river and flow resistance within a river (from the river bed, for example) can affect the shape of the floodwave. Oftentimes, the floodwave will be attenuated (have a reduced peak flow).\n\nRouting techniques can be broadly classified as hydraulic (or distributed) routing, hydrologic (or lumped) routing or semi-distributed routing.  In general, based on the available field data and goals of the project, one of routing procedures is selected.\n\nHydraulic (or distributed) routing\nHydraulic routing is based on the solution of partial differential equations of unsteady open-channel flow. The equations used are the Saint-Venant equations or the associated dynamic wave equations.\n\nThe hydraulic models (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically.\n\nHydrologic (or lumped) routing\nHydrologic routing uses the continuity equation for hydrology. In its simplest form, inflow to the river reach is equal to the outflow of the river reach plus the change of storage:\n\n, where\n\nI is average inflow to the reach during \nO is average outflow from the reach during ; and\nS is the water currently in the reach (known as storage)\n\nThe hydrologic models (e.g. linear and nonlinear Muskingum models) need to estimate hydrologic parameters using recorded data in both upstream and downstream sections of rivers and/or by applying robust optimization techniques to solve the one-dimensional conservation of mass and storage-continuity equation.\n\nSemi-distributed routing\nSemi-distributed models such as Muskingum\u2013Cunge family procedures are also available. Simple physical concepts and common river characteristics such as channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope are used to estimate the  model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions.",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Hydrologic and Hydraulic Routing: Key Concepts and Applications**  \n\nIn hydrology, *routing* is a critical technique used to predict how the shape of a hydrograph changes as water travels through a river channel or reservoir. This method is particularly valuable in flood forecasting, where hydrologists assess how a sudden, intense rainfall event upstream may transform by the time it reaches a downstream location, such as a city. Routing helps determine whether the water will arrive as a rapid deluge or a gradual trickle, enabling better flood risk management.  \n\n### **Fundamentals of Hydrologic Routing**  \nHydrologic (lumped) routing relies on the continuity equation, which establishes a relationship between inflow, outflow, and water storage within a river reach. The equation is expressed as:  \n\n\\[ I = O + \\Delta S \\]  \n\nWhere:  \n- **I** = Average inflow to the reach during a period.  \n- **O** = Average outflow from the reach during the same period.  \n- **S** = Water stored in the reach (storage).  \n\nThis equation ensures mass conservation, meaning the inflow must equal the outflow plus any change in storage. Hydrologic routing simplifies the process by using lumped storage relationships to predict hydrograph shapes, balancing inflow and outflow to determine how water is retained or released over time.  \n\n### **Hydraulic Routing: A More Detailed Approach**  \nIn contrast, hydraulic (distributed) routing employs complex numerical models, such as dynamic and diffusion wave models, which solve partial differential equations (e.g., the Saint-Venant equations) to simulate unsteady open-channel flow. Unlike hydrologic routing, hydraulic routing explicitly accounts for spatial and temporal flow dynamics, incorporating detailed river geometry and morphology.  \n\nThese models require extensive data on:  \n- Channel cross-sections and slope (topography/physiography).  \n- Geological and hydrogeological features (e.g., aquifers, forests).  \n- Stream-reach lengths and flow resistance.  \n\nThe accuracy of hydraulic models depends on precise representations of these factors, as they influence floodwave attenuation, hydrograph shape, and timing.  \n\n### **Factors Influencing Hydrograph Predictions**  \nSeveral sub-catchment characteristics affect hydrograph predictions in hydraulic models:  \n1. **Rainfall Timing and Duration** \u2013 Determines when and how long water enters the system.  \n2. **Antecedent Moisture Conditions** \u2013 Influences runoff versus absorption.  \n3. **Watershed Shape** \u2013 Affects flow convergence and peak timing.  \n4. **Land Slope and Topography** \u2013 Alters flow speed and direction.  \n5. **Geology and Hydrogeology** \u2013 Impacts water retention and slow release (e.g., through aquifers).  \n6. **Stream-Reach Lengths** \u2013 Modifies floodwave travel time and attenuation.  \n\nThese factors can lead to either:  \n- An **additive effect**, where simultaneous hydrograph peaks cause a large flood.  \n- A **distributed-in-time effect**, where successive peaks result in a more moderate flood.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nBoth hydrologic and hydraulic routing techniques use the concept of storage change (\u0394S) to predict hydrograph behavior. However, hydrologic routing simplifies the process with lumped storage relationships, while hydraulic routing incorporates detailed spatial and temporal dynamics through numerical modeling. The latter\u2019s reliance on precise river geometry and morphology data makes it computationally intensive but highly accurate for flood forecasting and water resource management.  \n\nBy understanding these methods, hydrologists can better predict flood risks and optimize mitigation strategies.",
    "final state": "I is average inflow to the reach during \nO is average outflow from the reach during ; and\nS is the water currently in the reach (known as storage)\n\nThe hydraulic models (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically.\n\nIn hydrology, routing is a technique used to predict the changes in shape of a hydrograph as water moves through a river channel or a reservoir. In flood forecasting, hydrologists may want to know how a short burst of intense rain in an area upstream of a city will change as it reaches the city. Routing can be used to determine whether the pulse of rain reaches the city as a deluge or a trickle.\n\nHydraulic models require data related to river geometry and morphology. Routing helps predict the impact of rainfall on downstream areas by determining how a pulse of rain changes as it moves through a river channel or reservoir, such as whether it arrives as a deluge or a trickle, and by predicting hydrograph shapes subsequent to multiple rainfall events in different sub-catchments of the watershed.\n\nIn the context of hydrologic (lumped) routing, the variables I, O, and S are related through the continuity equation for hydrology. The equation states that the average inflow to a river reach (I) during a period is equal to the average outflow from the reach (O) during the same period plus the change in water storage within the reach (S). \n\nThe relationship is expressed as:  \n\\[ I = O + \\Delta S \\]  \n\nHere:  \n- **I** represents the average inflow to the reach.  \n- **O** represents the average outflow from the reach.  \n- **S** represents the water currently stored in the reach.  \n\nThis equation ensures the conservation of mass in the system and is fundamental to hydrologic routing techniques. The document does not explicitly link these variables to hydraulic (distributed) routing, which instead relies on solving partial differential equations like the Saint-Venant equations.\n\nIn hydrologic routing, the change in water storage (\u0394S) is directly accounted for in the continuity equation (I - O = \u0394S), where it influences the prediction of hydrograph shapes by balancing the inflow (I) and outflow (O) to determine how water is stored or released over time. This affects the timing and magnitude of the hydrograph peaks.\n\nIn hydraulic routing, the change in water storage is implicitly considered through the solution of partial differential equations (e.g., Saint-Venant equations), which describe unsteady open-channel flow dynamics. Here, storage changes are influenced by channel geometry, flow resistance, and other distributed factors, affecting the attenuation and shape of the hydrograph.\n\nBoth techniques use \u0394S to predict hydrograph shapes, but hydrologic routing simplifies it via lumped storage relationships, while hydraulic routing models it in detail using spatial and temporal flow dynamics.\n\nVariations in river geometry and morphology affect the predictions made by dynamic and diffusion wave models in hydraulic routing because these models require gathering a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology to solve the partial differential equations of unsteady open-channel flow (Saint-Venant equations or dynamic wave equations) numerically. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the detailed and accurate representation of these river characteristics.\n\nDifferent sub-catchment characteristics influence the predictions of hydrograph shapes in dynamic and diffusion wave models by affecting factors such as timing, duration, and additive or distributed effects of multiple rainfall events. These characteristics include:\n\n1. **Timing and duration of rainfall events**: Determines when and how long water enters the system.\n2. **Antecedent moisture conditions**: Affects how much water is absorbed or runs off.\n3. **Watershed and sub-catchment shapes**: Influences how water converges and flows downstream.\n4. **Land slopes (topography/physiography)**: Impacts the speed and direction of water flow.\n5. **Geology/hydrogeology (e.g., forests, aquifers)**: Determines absorption and slow release of water.\n6. **Stream-reach lengths**: Affects travel time and attenuation of floodwaves.\n\nThese factors can lead to either an additive effect (large flood if hydrograph peaks coincide) or a distributed-in-time effect (modest, attenuated flood if peaks arrive successively). Dynamic and diffusion wave models account for these by incorporating detailed river geometry, morphology, and numerical solutions of unsteady open-channel flow equations.\n\nDynamic and diffusion wave models integrate topographic and geological data by requiring extensive data related to river geometry and morphology. This includes factors such as land slopes (topography/physiography), geology/hydrogeology (e.g., forests and aquifers that absorb and release rainfall), and stream-reach lengths. These models use this data to numerically solve the partial differential equations of unsteady open-channel flow (Saint-Venant equations or dynamic wave equations), refining predictions of hydrograph shapes in response to rainfall events.",
    "reconstructed document from partial obs": "**Understanding Hydrological Routing and Its Applications**  \n\nIn hydrological studies, key variables are used to describe water movement:  \n- **I** represents the average inflow into a river reach during a given period.  \n- **O** denotes the average outflow from the reach during the same period.  \n- **S** refers to the water currently stored within the reach, known as storage.  \n\nHydraulic models, such as dynamic and diffusion wave models, are essential tools for simulating water flow. However, these models demand extensive data on river geometry and morphology. Additionally, they require significant computational resources to solve the governing equations numerically.  \n\n### **The Role of Routing in Hydrology**  \nRouting is a fundamental technique in hydrology used to predict how the shape of a hydrograph changes as water travels through a river channel or reservoir. This method is particularly valuable in flood forecasting. For example, hydrologists might analyze how a brief, intense rainfall event upstream of a city will transform by the time it reaches the urban area. Through routing, they can determine whether the water will arrive as a sudden flood or a gradual, manageable flow.  \n\nBy leveraging these techniques, hydrologists can better anticipate and mitigate potential flood risks, ensuring more informed decision-making for water management and disaster preparedness.",

    "document": "Alan Stuart Gross (born April 13, 1962) is an American politician, orthopedic surgeon and a commercial fisherman who, running as an independent candidate, was the Democratic nominee for the 2020 United States Senate election in Alaska. He lost the race to incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan.\n\nEarly life and education\nGross was born in Juneau in 1962. He is the son of former Alaska Attorney General Avrum and Shari Gross, the first Executive Director of the United Fishermen of Alaska, who also founded the League of Women Voters-Alaska. As a child, he was part of the small Jewish community in Alaska, and had the first bar mitzvah in Southeast Alaska. While attending Douglas High School in Juneau, Gross developed an interest in fishing, both sport and commercial. When he was 14, he bought his first commercial fishing boat with a bank loan. He commercially gillnet fished for salmon in the summer to pay his way through college and medical school.\n\nGross attended Douglas High School in Juneau before enrolling at Amherst College, where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in neuroscience. He studied medicine at the University of Washington\u2019s WWAMI Regional Medical Education Program, graduating in 1989.\n\nMedical career\nAfter graduating from medical school, Gross served as the president of the Bartlett Regional Hospital medical staff. In 2006, he founded and served as the president of the Juneau Bone and Joint Center. Gross retired from full-time orthopedic surgery in 2013, but continues to work part time for the Petersburg Medical Center, and volunteers at a training hospital in Cambodia every year.\n\nGross practiced as an orthopedic surgeon in Juneau, beginning in 1994. In 2013, Gross left his practice, along with his wife Monica Gross, to study health care economics, earning a master's of public health at University of California, Los Angeles. He has said that he grew uncomfortable with the high costs of healthcare, and pursued his MPH degree to study solutions.\n\nPolitical career\nAfter earning his MPH, Gross returned to Alaska and began his advocacy for healthcare reform. In 2017, he co-sponsored two ballot initiatives in Alaska. The Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act sought to add certain provisions from the Affordable Care Act into state law, including protection against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and provisions that children could remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. The Healthcare for Alaskans Act would codify the Medicaid expansion, already in effect due to an executive order by Governor Bill Walker. Both initiatives were withdrawn from the ballot in December 2017. Supporters cited uncertainty in healthcare policy at the federal level as the reason for the withdrawal.\n\n2020 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nOn July 2, 2019, Gross announced he would run as an independent in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Alaska. He won the August Democratic primary against Democrat Edgar Blatchford and Independent Chris Cumings, gaining the nomination of the Alaska Democratic Party, which had endorsed him before the filing deadline.\n\nGross ran as an independent against Republican incumbent Senator Dan Sullivan. He had the support of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and The Lincoln Project.\n\nGross said, \"I stepped up to do this because the Alaska economy has been failing, we\u2019ve been losing Alaskans to the Lower 48 for the past few years, and despite that labor loss, we had the highest unemployment in the country.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast argued that Alaska \"flirts with purple-state status\" in part due to Gross's candidacy. There was speculation that the political fallout of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination could dampen support for incumbent Sullivan and benefit Gross's campaign.\n\nMore than a week after the election, Sullivan's reelection in what was expected to be a close race was affirmed.",

    "document": "Martin Andrew Crimp (born 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent) is a British playwright.\n\nEarly life and career\nThe son of John Crimp, a British Rail signalling engineer, and his wife Jennie, Crimp's family moved in 1960 to Streatham where he attended a local primary school before winning a scholarship to Dulwich College. But when his father was transferred to York, he went to the nearby Pocklington School, where he showed an aptitude for languages, music, English literature, and theatre. He read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1975\u201378), where his first play Clang was staged by fellow student Roger Michell. Before establishing himself as a playwright, he put together An Anatomy, a collection of short stories, and also wrote a novel Still Early Days. These remain unpublished.\n\nHis first six plays were performed at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond. As he told Marsha Hanlon in an interview for the Orange Tree appeal brochure in 1991: \"When the Orange Tree ran a workshop for local writers [in September 1981], I was invited to take part. The carrot was the chance of a lunchtime production, so I wrote Living Remains and the Orange Tree staged it \u2013 my first-ever produced play! I was so excited that I didn't think about the space where it was performed [then a room above a pub], but now I realise that the Orange Tree's intimacy and simplicity provided an extra layer of excitement.\"\n\nSeven of his plays, and his second Ionesco translation have also been presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, where he became writer-in-residence in 1997.\n\nProfessional career\n\nPlaywright \nCrimp\u2019s play Attempts on Her Life, which premiered at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in 1997, was described by critic Aleks Sierz as the \"event that secured his reputation as the most innovative, most exciting, and most exportable playwright of his generation\" [Sierz, Aleks, Aleks, (2013) p.48]. The play presents a unique structure, as none of the lines are assigned to specific characters, and Crimp does not specify the number of actors required to perform the piece. The play consists of seventeen seemingly unrelated scenes in which groups of people provide contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman who is discussed as a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist, and even a new car. Through its deliberate fragmentation, Attempts on Her Life challenges the audience to reconsider their understanding of what constitutes a \"play\" and raises questions about the existence of individuals beyond the constructs we create.\n\nHis other plays range from tragi-comic studies of suburban guilt and repression \u2014 Definitely the Bahamas (1987), Dealing with Clair (1989), The Country (2000) \u2014 via the satirical \u2018entertainment\u2019 In the Republic of Happiness (2012) \u2014 to powerful re-writings of Greek classics \u2014 Cruel & Tender (2004), The Rest Will Be Familiar to You from Cinema (2013). This unusual variety has led Vicky Angelaki to write:\n\nCrimp's work has successfully received numerous productions abroad. In Germany, he is considered to be \"one of the most respected British playwrights\" and it was reported in 2013 that there has been \"more than 60 German-language productions of his work in the past two decades.\"\n\nIn 2021, Crimp was recipient of Germany\u2019s Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize in recognition of the importance of his body of work.\u00a0[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 29 March 2021] Writing about the prize in Theater heute magazine, Till Briegleb praises the way that \u201cWith great authority, Crimp sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible. From the murderer to the child, everyone who appears is unique, their life-lies and fears individual.\u201d\n\nMartin Crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the \"in-yer-face\" school of contemporary British drama, although he rejects the label.\n\nIn 2022, he performed his play Not one of these people, which gave voice to 299 different characters. Supported with a live deepfake video generator, imagined by Quebec director Christian Lapointe, the playwright accepted Lapointe\u2019s invitation to perform as an actor on stage for the first time.\n\nTheatre translator \nFrom 1997 onwards, Crimp has had a parallel career as theatre translator, making his first impact at the Royal Court Theatre with a translation of Ionesco\u2019s The Chairs, a production that subsequently transferred to Broadway. His re-writings of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Misanthrope (1996, revived 2009) and Rostand\u2019s Cyrano de Bergerac (2019/22) were both commercially and critically successful, the latter transferring from London\u2019s West End to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. These rewritings have led some critics to see them as new plays. Angelaki, for example, argues that \"Crimp\u2019s radical adaptations \u2026 depart substantially from the early versions of the texts that inspire them and as such belong to a discussion of Crimp\u2019s playwriting canon, rather than of his translations or versions\" [Angelaki, Vicky, Op. Cit. page 154]",

For example, *Attempts on Her Life* (1997, Royal Court Theatre) presents contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist\u2014depicted as a terrorist, grieving parents\u2019 daughter, artist, or even a car\u2014challenging perceptions of identity and societal constructs. Another play, *The Country* (2000, Royal Court), explores suburban guilt and repression, while *Cruel & Tender* (2004, Royal Court) reimagines Greek tragedy to critique modern violence and complicity.

        "answer": "Crimp\u2019s use of fragmented narratives, particularly in *Attempts on Her Life* (1997) at the Royal Court Theatre, contributes to exploring societal violence and individual lives by deliberately destabilizing traditional storytelling. The play consists of seventeen unrelated scenes where an absent protagonist is described contradictorily\u2014as a terrorist, an artist, or even a car\u2014without assigned lines or fixed characters. This fragmentation forces the audience to piece together meaning, highlighting how societal constructs shape perceptions of identity and violence. The lack of a coherent narrative mirrors the disjointed nature of bourgeois society\u2019s relationship to violence, as noted by Till Briegleb, where individuals\u2019 \"life-lies and fears\" are exposed as uniquely tied to the violence enabling their existence. The play\u2019s structure itself becomes a technique, challenging audiences to question how narratives are constructed and how individuals exist beyond societal labels."

This structure challenges the audience to piece together contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, who is portrayed in various roles (e.g., a terrorist, an artist, a car). By doing so, the play forces a reconsideration of how individuals are constructed through societal narratives, exposing the violence embedded in these constructs. As Till Briegleb notes, Crimp \"sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible,\" highlighting the tension between societal violence and individual identities. The unanchored dialogue underscores the instability of identity and the ways societal forces shape or erase it."

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Martin Crimp: A Playwright of Fragmented Realities and Bourgeois Contradictions**  \n\nMartin Andrew Crimp, born on 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent, is a celebrated British playwright whose works delve into the hidden violence and contradictions of bourgeois society. In 2021, he was awarded Germany\u2019s prestigious Nyssen-Bansemer Theater Prize, a testament to the significance of his body of work. Theater critic Till Briegleb, writing in *Theater heute* magazine, commended Crimp\u2019s ability to portray \"the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible.\" Briegleb further praised Crimp\u2019s characters\u2014ranging from murderers to children\u2014as uniquely drawn, each grappling with individual \"life-lies and fears.\"  \n\nSeven of Crimp\u2019s plays, along with his second translation of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s work, have been staged at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre, where he served as writer-in-residence in 1997. His plays dissect societal violence by exposing the fragility of bourgeois complacency, revealing the unsettling truths beneath its polished surface.  \n\n### **Themes and Techniques: Unmasking Societal Violence**  \n\nCrimp\u2019s work consistently explores the dissonance between individual lives and the systemic violence that sustains societal norms. His plays fragment traditional narratives to mirror the instability of identity and the constructed nature of reality.  \n\nFor instance, *Attempts on Her Life* (1997, Royal Court Theatre) dismantles conventional storytelling through seventeen disjointed scenes. The absent protagonist is described in contradictory terms\u2014as a terrorist, a grieving parents\u2019 daughter, an artist, or even a car\u2014with no fixed characters or assigned dialogue. This deliberate ambiguity forces the audience to actively construct meaning, reflecting how societal labels shape and distort identity. The play\u2019s fragmented structure critiques the bourgeois tendency to obscure the violence that underpins its stability, a theme Briegleb highlights in his analysis.  \n\nSimilarly, *The Country* (2000, Royal Court) examines suburban repression and guilt, while *Cruel & Tender* (2004, Royal Court) reinterprets Greek tragedy to interrogate modern complicity in violence. These works employ fractured narratives to underscore the tension between personal lives and the broader structures of power.  \n\n### **Innovative Dialogue and Unstable Identities**  \n\nIn *Attempts on Her Life*, Crimp\u2019s refusal to anchor dialogue to specific characters amplifies the play\u2019s thematic concerns. The lack of clear attribution destabilizes perception, compelling the audience to question how narratives\u2014and identities\u2014are constructed. By presenting conflicting depictions of the protagonist, Crimp exposes the violence inherent in societal storytelling, where individuals are reduced to roles that serve dominant ideologies.  \n\nBriegleb\u2019s observation that Crimp \"sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society\" resonates deeply here. The playwright\u2019s technique lays bare the illusions that sustain privilege, revealing the individual fears and deceptions that mask systemic brutality.  \n\n### **Conclusion: A Legacy of Provocation**  \n\nMartin Crimp\u2019s plays challenge audiences to confront the unsettling intersections of violence, identity, and societal fiction. Through fragmented narratives and unmoored dialogue, he dismantles the facades of bourgeois tranquility, exposing the fractures beneath. His recognition by the Nyssen-Bansemer Prize affirms his enduring impact on contemporary theater\u2014a medium he wields to interrogate the stories we tell ourselves and the truths we choose to ignore.",
    "final state": "Martin Andrew Crimp (born 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent) is a British playwright.\n\nIn 2021, Crimp was recipient of Germany\u2019s Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize in recognition of the importance of his body of work.\u00a0[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 29 March 2021] Writing about the prize in Theater heute magazine, Till Briegleb praises the way that \u201cWith great authority, Crimp sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible. From the murderer to the child, everyone who appears is unique, their life-lies and fears individual.\u201d\n\nSeven of his plays, and his second Ionesco translation have also been presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, where he became writer-in-residence in 1997.\n\nMartin Andrew Crimp explores themes of \"the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible.\" His plays depict characters with \"life-lies and fears individual,\" highlighting the contradictions and violence underlying bourgeois society. These themes contributed to his recognition by the Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize.\n\nCrimp\u2019s plays reflect societal contradictions and violence by portraying diverse victims of bourgeois society, exposing their life-lies and fears while highlighting the violence underpinning their tranquil existence. For example, *Attempts on Her Life* (1997, Royal Court Theatre) presents contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist\u2014depicted as a terrorist, grieving parents\u2019 daughter, artist, or even a car\u2014challenging perceptions of identity and societal constructs. Another play, *The Country* (2000, Royal Court), explores suburban guilt and repression, while *Cruel & Tender* (2004, Royal Court) reimagines Greek tragedy to critique modern violence and complicity. These works fragment narratives to reveal the tension between individual lives and societal violence.\n\nCrimp\u2019s use of fragmented narratives, particularly in *Attempts on Her Life* (1997) at the Royal Court Theatre, contributes to exploring societal violence and individual lives by deliberately destabilizing traditional storytelling. The play consists of seventeen unrelated scenes where an absent protagonist is described contradictorily\u2014as a terrorist, an artist, or even a car\u2014without assigned lines or fixed characters. This fragmentation forces the audience to piece together meaning, highlighting how societal constructs shape perceptions of identity and violence. The lack of a coherent narrative mirrors the disjointed nature of bourgeois society\u2019s relationship to violence, as noted by Till Briegleb, where individuals\u2019 \"life-lies and fears\" are exposed as uniquely tied to the violence enabling their existence. The play\u2019s structure itself becomes a technique, challenging audiences to question how narratives are constructed and how individuals exist beyond societal labels.\n\nIn *Attempts on Her Life*, Crimp's approach to dialogue\u2014where lines are not assigned to specific characters and the number of actors is unspecified\u2014creates deliberate fragmentation. This structure challenges the audience to piece together contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, who is portrayed in various roles (e.g., a terrorist, an artist, a car). By doing so, the play forces a reconsideration of how individuals are constructed through societal narratives, exposing the violence embedded in these constructs. As Till Briegleb notes, Crimp \"sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible,\" highlighting the tension between societal violence and individual identities. The unanchored dialogue underscores the instability of identity and the ways societal forces shape or erase it.",

    "document": "London Central Bus Company Limited, trading as Go-Ahead London, is a bus company operating in South London. The London Central brand is a subsidiary of Go-Ahead London and operates services under contract to Transport for London.\n\nHistory\n\nLondon Central commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units. In September 1994, it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group for \u00a323.8\u00a0million. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nGarages\nLondon Central operates five bus garages.\n\nBexleyheath (BX)\nAs at January 2023, Bexleyheath garage operated routes 51, 89, 132, 244, 321 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 486, 624, 625, 658, B11, B12, B13 and B16.\n\nHistory\nBuilt as a trolleybus depot by the London Passenger Transport Board, Bexleyheath was the only new garage built for trolleybuses. The depot is a large and imposing building, slightly set back from the main road to enable parking on the forecourt, which was used as a terminus for route 122. Bexleyheath closed in 1986, with work transferred to Catford, Plumstead and Sidcup garages.\n\nIn 1988 it re-opened under the guise of Bexleybus, a low-cost unit set up by London Buses under de-regulation, and had a large and varied allocation from Iveco/Robin Hoods and MCW Metroriders to Leyland Olympians and Daimler Fleetlines. The move to set up the new company to tender for routes backfired, and in the next round of tendering only route B16 was awarded to Bexleybus, whilst London Central won nine.\n\nLondon Central took control of Bexleyheath garage and routes in 1990. Lately the garage has had a good utilisation figure, up to 139 in 2001 which necessitated parking in the rear yard and the forecourt. In January 2007, the garage received its first Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for use on route 486.\n\nThis garage also houses one of the companies iBus hubs, controlling routes for Bexleyheath, Morden Wharf, New Cross, and Peckham garages.\n\nIn 2022, Bexleyheath became the first bus garage in London to be equipped for 'opportunity charge' electric bus operation, whereby the bus is charged while terminating before starting its next journey. This was introduced on route 132 whose eastern terminus is at the garage. A gantry was installed at the garage connecting with a pantograph on the top of the bus. On 9 July 2022, a fleet of Alexander Dennis Enviro400EVs began to enter service on the route.\n\nCamberwell (Q)\nAs at September 2023, Camberwell garage operated routes 1, 12, 35, 40, 42, 100, 108D, 176, 185, 355, 360, 484, N1, N15 (additional workings only) and SL6. On 30 April 2016, route 345 passed to Abellio London. On 2 May 2020, route P5 passed to Abellio London with new Caetano e.City Gold Buses.\n\nHistory\nAlthough built in 1914, Camberwell garage was not used as a bus garage until 1919 as it had been requisitioned for the war effort. Once it came into use it was one of London's largest garages and also carried out body overhauls in 1940/41. The garage was bombed during World War II in 1940 with four buses being destroyed and 13 seriously damaged.",

    "document": "Airg\u00edalla (Modern Irish: Oirialla, English: Oriel, Latin: Ergallia) was a medieval Irish over-kingdom and the collective name for the confederation of tribes that formed it. The confederation consisted of nine minor kingdoms, all independent of each other but paying nominal suzerainty to an overking, usually from the most powerful dynasty. Airg\u00edalla at its peak roughly matched the modern dioceses of Armagh and Clogher, spanning parts of counties Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. Its main towns were Armagh and Clogher. The name's usage survives as a cultural area of folk tradition in South East Ulster and adjoining areas of County Louth.\n\nAccording to legend, Airg\u00edalla was founded by the Three Collas, who are said to have conquered what is now central Ulster from the Ulaid. The decisive victory was the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, said to have been fought around the year 331. However, this tale is thought to be mostly fiction, and the actual year and circumstances of how the Airg\u00edalla confederation came about is unknown.\n\nOriginally thought to have been under the dominance of the neighbouring Ulaid to the east, the territory of the Airg\u00edalla from the 6th century onwards was gradually eroded by the encroachment of their northern neighbours, the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, as well as the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to their south. From 735 they fell under the dominance of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, and by 827 had become their vassals. The kingdom of Airg\u00edalla was at its peak in the 12th century, under king Donnchad Ua Cerbaill. The later constricted kingdom of Airg\u00edalla survived in Monaghan\u2014which was known as Oirghialla and Oriel after the Norman Invasion of Ireland\u2014under the Mac Mathghamhna, until the end of the Gaelic order in Ireland.\n\nEtymology\nAirg\u00edalla may mean \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers\", and refers to both the Irish over-kingdom of Airg\u00edalla, and the confederation of tribes that formed it. It is commonly Anglicised as Oriel; however, archaic Angliciations include: Uriel, Orial, Orgialla, Orgiall, Oryallia, and Ergallia.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Norman invasion, the Anglicisation \"Uriel\" became the name of the part of Airg\u00edalla that had extended into modern-day County Louth. Similarly, the portion of Airg\u00edalla that survived in modern-day County Monaghan, became known as Oirghialla, from which derives the Anglicisation \"Oriel\".\n\nIn early manuscripts the Bishop of Clogher was styled Bishop of Oirialla.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to legend\nIn the beginning of the 4th century, three warlike brothers, known as the Three Collas, made a conquest of a great part of Ulster, which they wrested from the Ulaid. It was the after the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, fought around 331, that they founded Airg\u00edalla. In this battle the forces of the Three Collas defeated the forces of Fergus Foga, king of Ulster, who was slain, and the victors burned to the ground Emain Macha, the ancient capital of Ulaid.\n \nHowever, in general it can be shown that the origin legend was written (or composed) in the second quarter of the 8th century to seal their alliance with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\nHistorical emergence\nThe earliest reference to the Airg\u00edalla occurs in the Annals of Tigernach under the year 677, where the death of Dunchad mac Ultan, \"R\u00ed Oigriall\", is noted. However, it is suspected of being a retrospective interpolation. On the other hand, the entry in the Annals of Ulster under the year 697 which lists Mael Fothataig mac Mael Dub as \"Rex na nAirgialla\" may indeed be genuine. Both Mael Fothatag and his son, Eochu Lemnae (died 704), are listed among the guarantors of the \"C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in\" in 697. Thus it is believed that the Airg\u00edalla were probably in existence as an entity by then, or certainly by the opening years of the 8th century.\n\n8th\u201312th centuries\n\n13th\u201316th centuries",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**The Airg\u00edalla Confederation: History and Legacy**  \n\n**Etymology and Name**  \nThe term *Airg\u00edalla* is believed to derive from the Irish phrase meaning \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers.\" It refers to both the over-kingdom of Airg\u00edalla and the tribal confederation that comprised it. While commonly Anglicized as *Oriel*, older variants include *Uriel*, *Orial*, *Orgialla*, *Orgiall*, *Oryallia*, and *Ergallia*.  \n\n**Origins and Early History**  \nThe exact origins of the Airg\u00edalla confederation remain uncertain. According to legend, it was established by the Three Collas following their victory at the Battle of Achadh Leithdheirg around 331 AD, where they seized central Ulster from the Ulaid. However, this account is widely regarded as fictional. Scholars suggest the legend was crafted in the mid-8th century to strengthen an alliance with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.  \n\nThe earliest reliable mention of Airg\u00edalla appears in the *Annals of Ulster* under the year 697, which records Mael Fothataig mac Mael Dub as \"Rex na nAirgialla\" (King of the Airg\u00edalla). This indicates the confederation likely existed by the late 7th or early 8th century.  \n\n**Political Structure**  \nThe Airg\u00edalla confederation was composed of nine minor kingdoms, each politically independent but acknowledging a nominal overlordship from an overking, typically from the most powerful dynasty. While the overking received symbolic allegiance, the rulers of the minor kingdoms retained full autonomy. The document does not elaborate further on the specific roles or comparisons between the overking and subordinate rulers.  \n\n**Decline and External Dominance**  \nOver time, the confederation's sovereignty waned as it came under the influence of external powers. By 735, the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill had gained dominance over Airg\u00edalla, reducing it to vassalage by 827. Despite this, the kingdom experienced a resurgence in the 12th century under King Donnchad Ua Cerbaill. Later, its remnants persisted in Monaghan under the Mac Mathghamhna dynasty until the collapse of the Gaelic order in Ireland. This trajectory reflects a shift from loose confederation to external subjugation.  \n\n**Key Events and Shifts in Power**  \nSeveral pivotal events shaped the confederation\u2019s history:  \n1. **Legendary Foundation (c. 331 AD)**: The mythical victory of the Three Collas at Achadh Leithdheirg, including the destruction of the Ulaid capital, Emain Macha, served as a founding narrative, though its historicity is doubtful.  \n2. **Territorial Erosion (6th Century Onward)**: Encroachments by the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain and Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill gradually diminished Airg\u00edalla\u2019s territory.  \n3. **Subjugation (735\u2013827)**: The confederation fell under Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain control, becoming their vassals.  \n4. **12th Century Peak**: The reign of Donnchad Ua Cerbaill marked a high point of consolidated power.  \n5. **Post-Norman Survival**: The rump kingdom endured in Monaghan and Louth until the end of Gaelic rule.  \n\n**Conflicts and Alliances**  \nAirg\u00edalla\u2019s history was marked by both strife and cooperation:  \n- **Conflict with the Ulaid**: The legendary battle against the Ulaid established their foothold in central Ulster.  \n- **Pressure from Neighbors**: The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain and Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill steadily eroded their territory.  \n- **Alliance with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill**: The 8th-century origin legend cemented this political bond.  \n- **C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in (697)**: Airg\u00edalla leaders acted as guarantors for this legal code, showcasing their role in broader alliances.  \n\nThese interactions underscore the confederation\u2019s complex relationships with neighboring powers throughout its existence.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe Airg\u00edalla confederation\u2019s history reflects a journey from mythical origins to political prominence, followed by decline under external domination. Its legacy endured in fragmented form until the dissolution of Gaelic Ireland, leaving a nuanced imprint on the region\u2019s medieval history.",

    "document": "A cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. The term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejeculation outside the receiver's body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. Facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.\n\nThe term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \"couples erotica\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in \"girl-girl\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.\n\nCum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely.\n\nTerminology\nA cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot.\n\nOriginally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.\n\nOrigin and features\n\nAlthough earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature\u2014displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film Behind the Green Door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as \"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\". Steven Ziplow's The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography (1977) states:\n\nCum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene.\n\nAs a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.\n\nHealth risks\n\nTransmission of disease\nAny sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" or OPIM.\n\nAside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.",
    "partial_obs": "Health risks\n\nOriginally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films.

For instance, in an action thriller, an elaborate explosion might be labeled the film\u2019s \"money shot.\" However, the term took on a different meaning in pornography, where it came to denote scenes of ejaculation, with male performers reportedly paid extra for such sequences. This usage later influenced mainstream film and television, where the term was reappropriated to describe highly emotional, physically expressive moments\u2014such as dramatic outbursts on talk shows.  \n\nA *cum shot* specifically depicts human ejaculation, typically in pornographic media. Unlike real-life sexual encounters, these scenes often emphasize external ejaculation\u2014onto a partner\u2019s face, body, or other areas\u2014to ensure visibility for the viewer. Facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are particularly common, frequently serving as a scene\u2019s climax.

The current form of the Oath, along with its alternatives, is administered by the chief justice during official swearing-in ceremonies. For clarity, the oaths outlined below reflect how they would be presented if used today in English.  \n\n#### The Affirmation Alternative  \nAn affirmation begins with the declaration: *\"I, [name], solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm,\"* followed by the same legal wording as the Oath, but without any reference to God.  \n\n#### Key Differences Between the Oath and Affirmation  \n1. **Wording**:  \n   - The **Oath** includes a reference to God (implied by the Affirmation\u2019s omission of such language).  \n   - The **Affirmation** replaces the religious reference with a secular declaration while maintaining the same legal phrasing.  \n\n2. **Legal Effect**:  \n   - Both the Oath and Affirmation hold **identical legal weight** for government officials.  \n\nNo additional distinctions in wording or legal implications are provided in the document.  \n\n#### Governing Legislation  \nThe use of oaths and affirmations in New Zealand is primarily regulated by two key statutes:  \n1. **Oaths and Declarations Act 1957**: Defines the forms of oaths and affirmations, including the Oath of Allegiance, which may be taken in either M\u0101ori or English. It also confirms that affirmations carry the same legal validity as oaths.  \n2. **Constitution Act 1986**: Requires members of Parliament to take the Oath of Allegiance before participating in parliamentary proceedings.  \n\n#### Roles Requiring Oaths or Affirmations  \nThe following government officials must take an Oath or Affirmation of Office:  \n- **Governor-General**  \n- **Members of the Executive Council**  \n- **Members of the House of Representatives** (mandated by the Constitution Act 1986 prior to sitting or voting)  \n- **Parliamentary Under-Secretaries**  \n\n#### Notable Variations  \n- **Oath of Citizenship**: Includes an additional pledge: *\"and I will obey the laws of New Zealand and fulfil my duties as a New Zealand citizen.\"*  \n- **Affirmations**: Exclude references to God and begin with a formal declaration of sincerity.  \n- **Administration**: The chief justice oversees the swearing-in process for various offices, though the exact wording of each oath is not detailed in the document.  \n\nOaths may be administered in **M\u0101ori or English**, with affirmations retaining equal legal standing.

    "document": "The third government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n was the Government of Hungary between 6 June 2014 and 18 May 2018. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n formed his third cabinet after his party-alliance, Fidesz and its coalition partner, Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) altogether won a qualified majority in the 2014 parliamentary election.\n\nPolicy\n\nImmigration\n\nDuring the 2015 European migrant crisis the government initiated the erection of the Hungary-Serbia barrier to block entry of illegal immigrants. Just like the other Visegr\u00e1d Group leaders, the government was against any compulsory EU long-term quota on redistribution of migrants.\n\nOn 24 February 2016 the prime minister announced that the government would hold a Referendum on whether to accept the European Union's proposed mandatory quotas for relocating migrants. He also said it is \"no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas\" and that they will be campaigning for \"no\" votes. Orb\u00e1n argued that the quota system would \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do\". On 5 May, after examining the legal challenges, the Supreme Court (K\u00faria) allowed the holding of the referendum.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the no vote won with 3,362,224 votes or 98.36% of the total number of votes.\n\nFree Sunday\nFidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary) has supported the restriction on Sunday shopping (\"free Sunday\", as they called) for a long time, citing Christian values. Parliament voted on the issue on December 14, 2014 and the law came into effect on March 15, 2015 (a Sunday on which shops would have been closed anyway, the day being a public holiday in Hungary). Public opinion was predominantly against the decision. Three polls done in the spring of 2015 registered an opposition of 64% (Szonda Ipsos), 62% (Medi\u00e1n) 59% (T\u00e1rki). By the end of May, according to a poll by Medi\u00e1n, 72% of those polled disliked the new law, even the majority of Fidesz-KDNP voters were against it. Opposition parties and private persons tried to start a public referendum several times. By November 2015 there were 16 such attempts, but none of them were approved, for various bureaucratic reasons, until in early 2016 one of these attempts, initiated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, was finally successful. The government, rather than being forced to hold the referendum (which could have been interpreted as a huge success for the opposition party, even though the law was opposed by the majority of Fidesz voters too) lifted the ban in April 2016.\n\nNGO Law\nOn 13 June 2017, The Hungarian Parliament Passed a Law Targeting Foreign-Funded NGOs. The law requires civil groups receiving foreign donations above a certain threshold to register as organizations funded from abroad. The law was passed 130 to 44, with 25 abstaining.\n\nParty breakdown\n\nBeginning of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the beginning of term:\n\nEnd of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the end of term:\n\nMembers of the Cabinet",

This outcome reflected the Hungarian government\u2019s firm stance against EU-imposed migration policies.  \n\n### **Migration and Border Control**  \nDuring the 2015 European migrant crisis, the Hungarian government constructed the Hungary-Serbia barrier to prevent the entry of undocumented migrants. Opposing any compulsory EU quota system for redistributing migrants, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n announced a referendum on the issue in February 2016, advocating for a rejection of the EU\u2019s relocation plan. The resounding \"no\" vote later that year reinforced the government\u2019s position.  \n\n### **\"Free Sunday\" Legislation and Public Opposition**  \nIn a move rooted in conservative Christian values, the government imposed restrictions on Sunday shopping, enacting the \"free Sunday\" law on 15 March 2015. However, the policy faced significant public backlash, with polls indicating opposition rates between 59% and 72%. Despite efforts by opposition groups and private citizens to initiate a referendum, none were approved before the government repealed the ban in April 2016.  \n\n### **Regulation of Foreign-Funded NGOs**  \nOn 13 June 2017, the Hungarian Parliament passed legislation requiring civil society organizations receiving substantial foreign funding to register as foreign-backed entities. This measure aligned with the government\u2019s broader emphasis on national sovereignty and resistance to external influence, mirroring its opposition to EU migration policies.  \n\n### **Political Climate and Public Sentiment**  \nUnder Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s third government, policies prioritized national sovereignty, conservative values, and skepticism toward foreign interference. While anti-immigration measures, such as the border barrier and the 2016 referendum, enjoyed strong public support, the \"free Sunday\" law was notably unpopular. The passage of the NGO legislation (approved by a vote of 130 to 44) further underscored the government\u2019s agenda, though public opinion on this specific issue remains unspecified.  \n\nThese policies collectively shaped Hungary\u2019s political landscape, reflecting both governmental priorities and divergent public reactions.",

As a result of his participation, Cuadros published his collection of poetry and fiction, City of God(1994).\n\nThrough her Visions and Revisions Writing Program at Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres (1986) and the Perspectives Writing Program at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center (1988\u20131997), Wolverton provided platforms for marginalized voices. Notably, Gil Cuadros, a Mexican American poet diagnosed with AIDS, attended her HIV-focused workshops, leading to the publication of his acclaimed collection *City of God* (1994). These programs fostered creative expression and community engagement, particularly for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people living with HIV, amplifying underrepresented narratives in Los Angeles.\n\nThe founding of Writers at Work in 1997 built upon Wolverton's earlier programs by continuing her established methodologies of teaching performance skills and creative writing. Prior to this, she developed the Visions and Revisions Writing Program at Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres in 1986 and launched the Perspectives Writing Program at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center in 1988, where she taught until 1997. Writers at Work expanded her work by providing a dedicated creative writing center where she could teach fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, as well as offer creative consultations to writers, furthering her commitment to nurturing literary talent.\n\nTerry Wolverton's early experiences and influences significantly shaped her approach to teaching and the establishment of Writers at Work. Her grandmother, Elsba Mae Miller, a former English teacher, read and recited poetry to her, inspiring Wolverton's love of language. This early exposure to poetry and language likely influenced her later focus on creative writing and teaching.  \n\nWolverton's education in the arts, including her graduation from the Performing Arts curriculum at Cass Technical High School and her studies in Theatre, Psychology, and Women's Studies at the University of Toronto, provided a multidisciplinary foundation. Her participation in feminist programs like Sagaris and the Women, World, and Wonder program at Thomas Jefferson College further deepened her engagement with feminist and creative perspectives.  \n\nThese experiences informed her teaching methods, as seen in her development of writing programs like Visions and Revisions and Perspectives, which emphasized creative expression and inclusivity. Her establishment of Writers at Work in 1997 reflects her commitment to fostering creative writing, drawing from her own artistic background and early influences.",
    "reconstructed document from partial obs": "**Terry Wolverton: A Lifelong Dedication to Writing and Teaching**  \n\nIn 1997, Terry Wolverton established *Writers at Work*, a creative writing center where she teaches fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, while also offering personalized creative consultations to aspiring writers.  \n\n### Early Life and Influences  \nBorn on August 23, 1954, in Cocoa Beach, Florida, Wolverton spent her formative years in Detroit, Michigan. Her grandmother, Elsba Mae Miller, a former English teacher, played a pivotal role in nurturing her passion for language by reading and reciting poetry to her. From a young age, Wolverton was drawn to the arts, particularly writing, music, and drama. This early interest led her to graduate from the Performing Arts curriculum at Cass Technical High School in 1972.  \n\n### Teaching and Literary Contributions  \nWolverton\u2019s career as an educator began in 1977, when she started teaching performance skills and creative writing. A decade later, in 1986, she created the *Visions and Revisions Writing Program* at Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres. She further expanded her impact in 1988 by founding the *Perspectives Writing Program* at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, where she taught until 1997.  \n\nAmong the many writers who benefited from her workshops was Gil Cuadros, a Mexican American poet diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. Cuadros joined Wolverton\u2019s writing workshops for individuals living with HIV, an experience that ultimately led to the publication of his acclaimed collection of poetry and fiction, *City of God* (1994).  \n\nThrough her teaching and mentorship, Wolverton has left an enduring mark on the literary community, fostering creativity and empowering writers to find their voices.",

The town is well-connected by two access points to the A14 motorway (Autobahn) and boasts a unique historical distinction: it is home to Germany\u2019s last remaining horse-drawn tram line, the D\u00f6beln Tramway. Originally operational from 1892 to 1926, this charming transport system was revived in 2007, adding to the town\u2019s cultural allure.  \n\n### **Historical Landmarks and Cultural Heritage**  \n\nD\u00f6beln\u2019s rich past is reflected in its architectural and memorial landmarks:  \n\n1. **Castle Reichenstein**: Constructed in 1360 by Knight Ulmann of Staupitz, this fortress suffered significant damage in 1450 during the Saxon Fratricidal War and gradually fell into decline. By 1567, it was described as a \"deserted palace\" and later served as a quarry. After the devastating fire of 1730, its remnants were repurposed as building materials.  \n\n2. **Monastery**: Completed in 1330, the monastery stands as a testament to the town\u2019s early religious and architectural significance.  \n\n3. **Memorials**:  \n   - A memorial in front of the Crematorium honors 21 Polish and Russian forced laborers who perished during World War II.  \n   - The Wettinplatz memorial is dedicated to all victims of fascism.  \n   - A memorial at the Lessing School commemorates those who suffered under war and dictatorship between 1933 and 1989.  \n\n4. **D\u00f6beln Tramway**: As Germany\u2019s sole surviving horse-drawn tram line, its historical and transport value remains unparalleled.  \n\nThese sites highlight D\u00f6beln\u2019s medieval roots, its wartime struggles, and its commitment to preserving history.  \n\n### **Notable Historical Figures and Events**  \n\nSeveral key figures and events have shaped D\u00f6beln\u2019s identity:  \n\n- **Adolf of Nassau (1296)**: Seized control of the town and castle, marking an era of external dominance.  \n- **Knight Ulmann of Staupitz (1360)**: Founded Castle Reichenstein, reinforcing the town\u2019s medieval defenses.  \n- **Duke Wilhelm of Wettin (1450)**: His Bohemian forces ravaged D\u00f6beln during the Saxon Fratricidal War, crippling the castle\u2019s prominence.  \n- **Prince Henry of Prussia (1762)**: Led Prussian troops to victory against the Austrians near D\u00f6beln in the Seven Years' War.  \n- **Soviet Army (1945)**: Occupied the town without resistance, prompting the local issuance of postage stamps with Hitler\u2019s image defaced.  \n\nConflict and reconstruction have played pivotal roles in D\u00f6beln\u2019s evolution. The castle\u2019s destruction, repeated fires, and military clashes\u2014such as Hussite looting in 1429 and Swedish plundering in 1637\u2014underscored its strategic importance. Later developments, including its time as a garrison (1754\u20131810) and the arrival of railway connections (from 1847), further shaped its growth.  \n\n### **Natural Disasters and Rebuilding Efforts**  \n\nFires have profoundly impacted D\u00f6beln\u2019s development:  \n- **1333**: A catastrophic blaze destroyed the entire town.  \n- **1730**: Another devastating fire consumed 266 homeowners' and 400 renters' residences, prompting the reuse of Castle Reichenstein\u2019s ruins for reconstruction.  \n\nThese disasters necessitated extensive rebuilding, altering the town\u2019s architectural and infrastructural landscape over the centuries.  \n\nThrough its storied past, D\u00f6beln stands as a town where history is preserved in its landmarks, memorials, and unique traditions, offering a window into Saxony\u2019s medieval and modern legacy.",

    "document": "The Pembrokeshire Militia, later the Royal Pembroke Rifles, was an auxiliary regiment reorganised from earlier precursor units in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire during the 18th Century. Primarily intended for home defence, it served in Britain and Ireland through all Britain's major wars. It was converted into garrison artillery in 1853 and continued until it was disbanded in 1909.\n\nPembroke Trained Bands\n\nThe universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and   was extended to Wales. King Henry VIII called a 'Great Muster' in 1539, which showed the following available in the newly reorganised county of Pembrokeshire:\n County of Pembrokeshire: 1166 men available for service, of whom 139 had 'harness' (armour)\n Lordship of Haverfordwest: 454 (43 with harness)\n Tenants of Thomas Jones in both those places and in the Hundred of Dewisland: 380 with 4 'nags' (horses)\n Cilgerran Hundred: 254\n\nThe legal basis of the militia was updated by two Acts of 1557 covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. The county militia was now under the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by the Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace (JPs). The entry into force of these Acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised Militia of England and Wales. Although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the Trained Bands, who were mustered for regular training. During the Armada crisis of 1588 Pembrokeshire furnished 800 trained foot and 30 'petronel's (the petronel was an early cavalry firearm).\n\nIn the 16th Century little distinction was made between the militia and the troops levied by the counties for overseas expeditions. However, the counties usually conscripted the unemployed and criminals rather than send the trained bandsmen. Between 1585 and 1602 Pembrokeshire supplied 610 men for service in Ireland and 30 for the Netherlands. The levies were commanded by professional captains rather than local men: in 1601 a captain who had raised 100 troops in Gloucestershire was ordered to take the 50 from Pembrokeshire under his  command as well. The men were given 'conduct money' to get to the embarkation ports. This was recovered from the government, but replacing the weapons issued to the levies from the militia armouries was a heavy cost on the counties.\n\nWith the passing of the threat of invasion, the trained bands declined in the early 17th Century. Later, King Charles I attempted to reform them into a national force or 'Perfect Militia' answering to the king rather than local control. The Pembrokeshire Trained Bands of 1638 consisted of 557 men, 276 armed with muskets and 281 'Corslets' (body armour, signifying pikemen). They also mustered 57 horse. Part of this force may have been organised as the North Pembroke Trained Band. Pembrokeshire was ordered to send 300 men overland to Newcastle upon Tyne for the Second Bishops' War of 1640. However, substitution was rife and many of those sent on this unpopular service would have been untrained replacements.\n\nCivil Wars\nControl of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between Charles I and Parliament that led to the English Civil War. When open war broke out between the King and Parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. Most of Wales was under Royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the King's armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby leaning towards Parliament. These were vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. On 18 September 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the Earl of Carbery as the King's Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire TBs to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament.\n\nOnce Parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed new Militia Acts that replaced lords lieutenant with county commissioners appointed by Parliament or the Council of State. At the same time the term 'Trained Band' began to disappear in most counties. Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the New Model Army to control the country. By 1651 the militias of the South Welsh counties appear to have been combined, with the 'South Wales Militia' being ordered to rendezvous at Gloucester to hold the city during the Worcester campaign.\n\nPembrokeshire Militia\nAfter the Restoration of the Monarchy, the Militia was re-established by the The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661 under the control of the king's lords lieutenant, the men to be selected by ballot. This was popularly seen as the 'Constitutional Force' to counterbalance a 'Standing Army' tainted by association with the New Model Army that had supported Cromwell's military dictatorship.\n\nThe militia forces in the Welsh counties were small, and were grouped together under the direction of the Lord President of the Council of Wales. As Lord President, the Duke of Beaufort carried out a tour of inspection of the Welsh militia in 1684. On 11 August, when he inspected the Pembrokeshire Militia near Haverfordwest, it consisted of a regiment of foot ('all of firelocks', ie musketeers with no pikemen) and one Troop of horse. The 1697 militia returns showed the foot as 456 strong under Colonel Sir Thomas Stepney, 5th Baronet, High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, organised in seven companies (one commanded by the Mayor of Pembroke), and the troop of 36 horse under Captain Arthur Owen, MP for Pembrokeshire.\n\nGenerally the militia declined in the long peace after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Jacobites were numerous amongst the Welsh Militia, but they did not show their hands during the Risings of 1715 and 1745, and bloodshed was avoided.\n\n1757 reforms",

While both sides prioritized securing county armouries for their professional forces, the Trained Bands saw limited direct use in the conflict. Much of Wales remained under Royalist control, serving as a key recruiting region for the King\u2019s armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby initially favoring Parliament. These ports held strategic importance, as they facilitated the Royalists\u2019 landing of supplies and reinforcements from Ireland.  \n\n**Shifting Allegiances**  \nOn 18 September 1643, the Earl of Carbery, the King\u2019s Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire Trained Bands to Haverfordwest. There, they pledged loyalty to the Crown and were likely integrated into the Royalist army as part of Carbery\u2019s campaign to secure Pembroke and Tenby. Despite this shift, Parliamentarian commander Rowland Laugharne later recaptured both towns for Parliament, though the exact role of the Trained Bands in this action remains unspecified.  \n\n**Strategic Significance**  \nThe recovery of Pembroke and Tenby by Laugharne disrupted Royalist supply lines and weakened their position in the region. The Trained Bands\u2019 initial alignment with the King and subsequent involvement in Parliament\u2019s counteroffensive underscored the volatility of local loyalties and the towns\u2019 military value. While details of their operational contributions are scarce, their participation highlights the broader struggle for control of vital resources and infrastructure during the war.  \n\n**Legacy of the 1643 Campaign**  \nThe events of 1643 illustrate the fluid dynamics of the conflict in Pembrokeshire. The Trained Bands\u2019 brief Royalist affiliation and the eventual Parliamentarian victory under Laugharne demonstrate how regional forces influenced wider wartime strategies. The episode also emphasizes the critical role of coastal strongholds in sustaining military campaigns, particularly for the Royalists\u2019 logistical needs.

    "document": "CrunchBang Linux (abbreviated #!) was a Linux distribution derived from Debian by Philip Newborough (who is more commonly known by his username, ).\n\nCrunchBang was designed to use comparatively few system resources. Instead of a desktop environment it used a customized implementation of the Openbox window manager. Many of its preinstalled applications used the GTK+ widget toolkit.\n\nCrunchBang had its own software repository but drew the vast majority of packages from Debian's repositories.\n\nPhilip Newborough announced on 6 February 2015 that he had stopped developing CrunchBang and that users would benefit from using vanilla Debian. Some Linux distributions have arisen in its place in an effort to continue its environment. Among the most significant are BunsenLabs and CrunchBang++.\n\nEditions \nCrunchBang Linux provided an Openbox version for i686, i486 and amd64 architectures. Until October 2010 there also was a \"Lite\" version  with fewer installed applications. The \"Lite\" version was effectively discontinued after the distribution on which it was based \u2013 Ubuntu 9.04 \u2013 reached its end-of-life and CrunchBang prepared to switch to a different base system.\n\nCrunchBang 10, made available in February 2011, was the first version based on Debian. The final version, CrunchBang 11, was made available on 6 May 2013.\n\nEach CrunchBang Linux release was given a version number as well as a code name, using names of Muppet Show characters. The first letter of the code name was the first letter of the upstream Debian release (previously Debian Squeeze and CrunchBang Statler and currently Debian Wheezy and CrunchBang Waldorf).\n\nReception\nIn May 2013 Jim Lynch of desktoplinuxreviews.com reviewed CrunchBang 11:\n\nSuccessors \nNewborough announced in February 2015 that he was abandoning further development of CrunchBang Linux, feeling that it no longer served a purpose. Many users disagreed, and a number of them proceeded to develop successor distributions BunsenLabs, CrunchBang++ (#!++) and CrunchBang-Monara.\n\nBunsenLabs\n\nBunsenLabs Linux is a community-organized successor to Crunchbang. It is based on the Debian 10 (Buster) stable release.

    "document": "Greek lyric is the body of lyric poetry written in dialects of Ancient Greek.\nIt is primarily associated with the early 7th to the early 5th centuries BC, sometimes called the \"Lyric Age of Greece\", but continued to be written into the Hellenistic and Imperial periods.\n\nBackground\n\nLyric is one of three broad categories of poetry in classical antiquity, along with drama and epic, according to the scheme of the \"natural forms of poetry\" developed by Goethe in the early nineteenth century. (Drama is considered a form of poetry here because both tragedy and comedy were written in verse in ancient Greece.) Culturally, Greek lyric is the product of the political, social and intellectual milieu of the Greek polis (\"city-state\").\n\nMuch of Greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. The symposium (\"drinking party\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed. \"Lyric\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithara) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). Whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the Greek word for \"song\" melos). Lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. This latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking.\n\nModern surveys of \"Greek lyric\" often include relatively short poems composed for similar purposes or circumstances that were not strictly \"song lyrics\" in the modern sense, such as elegies and iambics. The Greeks themselves did not include elegies nor iambus within melic poetry, since they had different metres and different musical instruments. The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome offers the following clarification: \"'melic' is a musical definition, 'elegy' is a metrical definition, whereas 'iambus' refers to a genre and its characteristics subject matter. (...) The fact that these categories are artificial and potentially misleading should prompt us to approach Greek lyric poetry with an open mind, without preconceptions about what 'type' of poetry we are reading.\"\n\nGreek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Partheneia, \"maiden-songs,\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals. Love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. In this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet, excelled. The themes of Greek lyric include \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" and hetero- and homosexual love.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, the encyclopedic movement at Alexandria produced a canon of the nine melic poets: Alcaeus, Alcman, Anacreon, Bacchylides, Ibycus, Pindar, Sappho, Simonides, and Stesichorus. Only a small sampling of lyric poetry from Archaic Greece, the period when it first flourished, survives. For example, the poems of Sappho are said to have filled nine papyrus rolls in the Library of Alexandria, with the first book alone containing more than 1,300 lines of verse. Today, only one of Sappho's poems exists intact, with fragments from other sources that would scarcely fill a chapbook.\n\nMeters\n\nGreek poetry meters are based on patterns of long and short syllables (in contrast to English verse, which is determined by stress), and lyric poetry is characterized by a great variety of metrical forms. Apart from the shift between long and short syllables, stress must be considered when reading Greek poetry. The interplay between the metric \"shifts\", the stressed syllables and caesuras is an integral part of the poetry. It allows the poet to stress certain words and shape the meaning of the poem.\n\nThere are two main divisions within the meters of ancient Greek poetry: lyric and non-lyric meters. \"Lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. The lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. Some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of Sappho and Alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of Pindar.\"\n\nThe lyric meters' families are the Ionic, the Aeolic (based on the choriamb, which can generate varied kinds of verse, such as the glyconian or the Sapphic stanza), and the Dactylo-epitrite. The Doric choral songs were composed in complex triadic forms of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, with the first two parts of the triad having the same metrical pattern, and the epode a different form.\n\nBibliography",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**The Rich Tradition of Greek Lyric Poetry**  \n\nGreek lyric poetry encompasses a wide range of themes and forms, serving both public and private purposes. These poems celebrated athletic victories (*epinikia*), honored the dead, inspired soldiers to bravery, and expressed religious devotion through hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Among the distinctive forms were *partheneia*, or \"maiden-songs,\" performed by choruses of young women during festivals. Love poetry also held a prominent place, praising beloved figures, voicing longing, attempting seduction, or even rebuking former lovers. In some cases, love poetry merged with invective\u2014a sharp, insulting style mastered by Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet. The subject matter of these works was vast, covering politics, war, sports, drinking, wealth, youth, aging, death, mythology, and both heterosexual and homosexual love.  \n\n### **Meter and Musical Accompaniment**  \nAncient Greek poetry is broadly divided into lyric and non-lyric meters. Lyric meters, originally sung to the lyre, were typically less regular, composed of varying foot patterns and line lengths. Some were designed for monody (solo performance), as seen in the works of Sappho and Alcaeus, while others were structured for choral dances, including tragic choruses and Pindar\u2019s victory odes.  \n\nGreek lyric poetry was often occasional, created for specific events and performed by soloists or choruses. The symposium, or drinking party, was a common setting for such performances. These poems were sometimes accompanied by string instruments like the lyre or kithara, or by wind instruments such as the *aulos* (a reed pipe). When performed with musical accompaniment, the poetry was termed *melic* (from the Greek *melos*, meaning \"song\"). Alternatively, lyric poetry could be recited without music, a form known as *meter*.  \n\n### **Performance Contexts: Monody vs. Choral Lyric**  \nMonodic lyric performances featured a single singer, often accompanied by a lyre, kithara, or *aulos*, and were typically associated with intimate gatherings like symposia. These songs were personal and metrically irregular. In contrast, choral lyric involved group performances for public events such as festivals or athletic victories. These works followed more complex metrical structures, often arranged in triadic forms (strophe, antistrophe, and epode). Doric choral songs, in particular, were known for their elaborate compositions.  \n\nDithyrambs, a key form of choral lyric, were hymns dedicated to Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy. Performed during religious festivals, they combined song and dance, embodying the communal and spiritual essence of Greek worship. Alongside hymns and paeans, dithyrambs reinforced the role of lyric poetry in religious devotion.  \n\n### **Themes and Settings: Private vs. Public**  \nIn private symposium settings, lyric poetry included love poems, drinking songs, and occasionally invective\u2014poetic attacks on personal enemies. Public performances, however, were more communal, featuring victory odes (*epinikia*), religious hymns, and maiden-songs (*partheneia*). These works celebrated collective achievements, honored deities, or commemorated the dead.  \n\nMusical accompaniment also varied by context: symposium performances might feature a lyre or *aulos* (melic poetry) or be recited without instruments (meter), while public choral works incorporated intricate dance and song structures.  \n\n### **Key Poets: Sappho and Pindar**  \nTwo of the most renowned Greek lyric poets, Sappho and Pindar, exemplify the diversity of the tradition.  \n\n- **Sappho**:  \n  Prolific in her output, her works filled nine scrolls in the Library of Alexandria, with her first book alone exceeding 1,300 lines. Today, only one complete poem survives, alongside fragments. She composed in monody, using Aeolic meters like the Sapphic stanza. Her poetry explored themes of love\u2014expressing desire, admiration, and sometimes scorn\u2014blurring into invective in moments of personal grievance.  \n\n- **Pindar**:  \n  Known for his choral lyric, particularly his *epinikia* (victory odes), Pindar celebrated athletic triumphs in elaborate triadic structures (strophe, antistrophe, epode) using Dactylo-epitrite meters. His works were performed publicly, emphasizing heroism, divine favor, and communal pride.  \n\nBoth poets were included in the Alexandrian canon of nine melic poets, representing the breadth of Greek lyric poetry\u2014from intimate monody to grand choral celebrations.  \n\nThrough its varied forms, themes, and performance contexts, Greek lyric poetry remains a testament to the artistic and cultural richness of the ancient world.",
    "final state": "Greek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Partheneia, \"maiden-songs,\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals. Love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. In this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet, excelled. The themes of Greek lyric include \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" and hetero- and homosexual love.\n\nThere are two main divisions within the meters of ancient Greek poetry: lyric and non-lyric meters. \"Lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. The lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. Some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of Sappho and Alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of Pindar.\"\n\nMuch of Greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. The symposium (\"drinking party\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed. \"Lyric\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithara) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). Whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the Greek word for \"song\" melos). Lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. This latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking.\n\nIn ancient Greece, solo monodic lyric performances were typically sung by a single performer, often accompanied by a string instrument like the lyre or kithara, or a wind instrument such as the aulos. These performances were associated with settings like the symposium. In contrast, choral lyric performances involved a group (chorus) and were often composed for public occasions, such as festivals or athletic victories, with more complex metrical structures and sometimes intricate triadic forms (strophe, antistrophe, and epode). While monodic songs were more personal and irregular in meter, choral lyrics were structured for group dance and song, with Doric choral songs being particularly elaborate.\n\nDithyrambs were a form of Greek lyric poetry that played a significant role in ancient Greek religious devotion. They were composed as hymns to honor Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy, and were performed by choruses during festivals. These performances were integrated into choral dances and were part of the broader tradition of melic poetry, which was often accompanied by musical instruments like the lyre or aulos. The dithyrambs' celebratory and devotional nature contributed to the communal and spiritual aspects of Greek religious festivals. The document also notes that Greek lyric poems, including dithyrambs, were used to offer religious devotion alongside other forms like hymns and paeans.\n\nIn private symposium settings, Greek lyric poetry was performed by a soloist or chorus to accompany drinking parties. The thematic content in these contexts often included love poems (praising the beloved, expressing desire, or lamenting breakups), drinking songs, and sometimes invective (poetic attacks).  \n\nIn public festival occasions, lyric poetry was composed for events such as athletic victories (epinikia), religious devotion (hymns, paeans, dithyrambs), or maiden-songs (partheneia) performed by choruses of maidens. The themes here were more communal, celebrating victories, honoring gods, commemorating the dead, or exhorting soldiers to valor.  \n\nThe performance contexts also differed in musical accompaniment: symposium poetry could be sung with a lyre or aulos (melic poetry) or recited without instruments (meter), while public performances often involved choral dances and complex triadic structures (strophe, antistrophe, epode) in Doric traditions.\n\nThe document provides specific information about the roles and contributions of Sappho and Pindar within Greek lyric poetry:\n\n1. **Sappho**:  \n   - Her poems were highly prolific, filling nine papyrus rolls in the Library of Alexandria, with the first book alone containing over 1,300 lines.  \n   - Today, only one intact poem survives, along with fragments.  \n   - Her works were composed in monody (solo songs) and used Aeolic meters, such as the Sapphic stanza.  \n   - Her themes often revolved around love, expressing desire, praise, or blame toward lovers, and her poetry blurred into invective in some cases.  \n\n2. **Pindar**:  \n   - He composed choral lyric, particularly epinikia (victory odes), celebrating athletic achievements.  \n   - His works were structured in complex triadic forms (strophe, antistrophe, and epode) with Dactylo-epitrite meters.  \n   - His poetry was performed in public settings, reinforcing themes of heroism, divine favor, and communal celebration.  \n\nBoth poets were part of the Alexandrian canon of nine melic poets, exemplifying the diversity of Greek lyric in form (monodic vs. choral) and theme (personal emotion vs. public commemoration).",
    "reconstructed document from partial obs": "**The Art and Themes of Greek Lyric Poetry**  \n\nGreek lyric poetry encompasses a rich variety of themes and forms, serving both public and private purposes. These poems celebrate athletic triumphs (*epinikia*), honor the deceased, inspire courage in soldiers, and express religious devotion through hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Among the choral traditions were the *partheneia*, or \"maiden-songs,\" performed by young women at festivals. Love poetry, another prominent genre, includes tributes to the beloved, lamentations of unrequited desire, playful seductions, and bitter reproaches directed at former lovers. In some cases, such reproaches blur into invective\u2014a sharp, mocking style used to shame personal enemies, a technique mastered by Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet. Broadly, the subject matter of Greek lyric spans \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" as well as love in both heterosexual and homosexual contexts.  \n\nGreek poetic meters fall into two primary categories: lyric and non-lyric. Lyric meters, originally intended to be sung with lyre accompaniment, are typically more irregular than non-lyric meters. Their lines consist of varying metrical feet and may differ in length.

This setup supported work-life balance by providing a quiet residential environment away from the locomotive yard while ensuring easy access to the workshops.\n\nThe Enginemans Resthouse provided accommodation for train drivers, firemen, and guards when they were away from their homes. It included a dining area that was occasionally used as a conference room, suggesting it served as a communal space for social interaction and possibly meetings among railway workers. Its design, featuring 13 principal rooms and verandahs on three sides, also indicates it was a significant gathering place for staff between shifts.",
