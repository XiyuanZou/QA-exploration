The riot ended peacefully on 3 September 1976 but over two thirds of the prison was destroyed,\nwith an estimated repair cost of \u00a33 \u2013 \u00a34\u00a0million. The prison was closed for a year while repairs were carried out. Disciplinary proceedings following the riots led to a number of legal challenges.\n\nThe Prison was removed from the high-security estate in 1985 and became a local prison holding inmates remanded and sentenced by courts in the area.\n\nIn 2002 a major expansion was completed making the prison more modern rather than Victorian, which added four new wings, a new gymnasium, a new health care centre and a multi-faith centre.\n\nIn January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that older parts of Hull Prison will close, with a reduction of 282 places at the prison. In April 2014 the Ministry of Justice announced that these would be brought back into use as the \"prison population is currently above published projections\".\n\nAfter rioting at Birmingham Prison in December 2016, some prisoners were transferred from Birmingham to Hull.  Disturbances were reported at HMP Hull.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, Staff at HMP Hull, along with many other prisons across the country, walked out under protest due to health and safety conditions across the prison estate. The protest was amid fears of rising violence, wanting safety improvements and a reduction in violence and overcrowding.\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that HMP Hull will be one of 10 prisons chosen for body scanners which aims to reduce drugs and violence, while improving standards, in the country's most challenging jails providing a template for the wider estate.\n\nIn January 2021, it was reported that HMP Hull had been dealing with a huge COVID-19 outbreak which saw around 80 prisoners and staff struck down by the virus.\n\nThe prison today\nHull is a local prison holding remand, sentenced and convicted males.

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**HMP Hull: A Historical Overview and Modern Operations**  \n\n### **Introduction**  \nHMP Hull is a Category B men\u2019s local prison located in Kingston upon Hull, England. As a \"local\" prison, it primarily holds remand prisoners awaiting trial at nearby courts, along with sentenced and convicted male inmates. Managed by His Majesty\u2019s Prison Service, the facility provides employment opportunities in workshops, kitchens, gardens, and waste management, as well as educational programs for prisoners.  \n\n### **Historical Background**  \nConstructed in 1870, HMP Hull features a classic Victorian design. One of its most infamous historical events was the execution of Ethel Major in 1934\u2014the last person and only woman to be hanged at the prison after being convicted of murdering her husband.  \n\nThe prison\u2019s rich history is preserved in the *\"Within These Walls\"* exhibition, which traces Hull\u2019s penal institutions from 1299 to 1934. Created by Officer Rob Nicholson, the exhibition was officially opened by Lawrence Major, Ethel\u2019s grandson. It highlights key themes such as the Victorian-era prison design and notable events, including Ethel Major\u2019s case.  \n\n### **Key Events in Modern History**  \n1. **1976 Riot**: A three-day uprising involving more than 100 prisoners erupted due to allegations of staff brutality. The riot caused extensive damage, destroying over two-thirds of the facility. Repairs cost between \u00a33\u20134 million, and the prison remained closed for a year.  \n2. **1985 Reclassification**: HMP Hull was removed from the high-security estate and reclassified as a local prison for remand and sentenced inmates.  \n3. **2002 Expansion**: A major modernization project introduced four new wings, a gymnasium, a healthcare center, and a multi-faith facility.  \n4. **2013\u20132014 Capacity Adjustments**: Older sections were initially scheduled for closure (reducing capacity by 282 beds) but were reopened due to rising prison populations.  \n5. **2016 Disturbances**: Following riots at Birmingham Prison, transferred inmates caused disruptions at HMP Hull.  \n6. **2018 Staff Protest**: Prison staff staged a walkout over health and safety concerns, citing escalating violence and overcrowding.  \n7. **2019 Body Scanner Trial**: The prison was selected as one of 10 facilities to test body scanners in an effort to curb drug smuggling and violence.  \n8. **2021 COVID-19 Outbreak**: A significant outbreak infected approximately 80 prisoners and staff members.  \n\n### **Current Operations**  \nToday, HMP Hull continues to house remand, sentenced, and convicted male prisoners. Inmates are engaged in various work assignments, including roles in workshops, kitchens, gardens, and waste management, alongside access to educational courses. The *\"Within These Walls\"* exhibition, launched in 2011, remains a key feature, documenting the prison\u2019s evolution from its medieval origins to the present day.  \n\n### **2018 Staff Protest: A Closer Look**  \nThe 2018 protest by prison staff was driven by deteriorating health and safety conditions across the estate. Employees called for enhanced safety measures, reduced violence, and solutions to overcrowding. While the document does not detail immediate outcomes, the protest underscored systemic challenges within the prison system.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nHMP Hull stands as a significant institution with a complex history, balancing its Victorian origins with modern penal responsibilities. From its role in housing diverse inmate populations to preserving its past through exhibitions, the prison remains a focal point in England\u2019s correctional system.",

    "document": "Chinook winds, or simply Chinooks, are two types of prevailing warm, generally westerly winds in western North America: Coastal Chinooks and interior Chinooks. The coastal Chinooks are persistent seasonal, wet, southwesterly winds blowing in from the ocean. The interior Chinooks are occasional warm, dry f\u00f6hn winds blowing down the eastern sides of interior mountain ranges. The coastal Chinooks were the original term, used along the northwest coast, and the term in the interior of North America is later and derives from the coastal term.\n Along the Pacific Northwest coast, where the name is pronounced  ('chin'+'uk'), the name refers to wet, warm winds off the ocean from the southwest; this is the original use of the term. The coastal Chinook winds deliver tremendous amounts of moisture both as rain along the coast and snow in the coastal mountains, that sustain the characteristic temperate rainforests and climate of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn North American western interior, the same name is used for f\u00f6hn winds, generally, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains lie immediately east of various interior mountain ranges. There the name is pronounced  ('shin'+'uk'). The same warm, wet coastal winds can also become the warm f\u00f6hn winds on the eastern sides of mountain ranges, after having lost their moisture on the western sides; however, due to expanded use of the term in the interior for any f\u00f6hn wind, interior Chinooks are not necessarily originally coastal Chinooks.\n\nIn the interior of North America, the Blackfoot people call these winds the \"snow eater\"; however, the more commonly used term \"Chinook\" originates from the name of the eponymous Chinook people, who lived near the ocean, along the lower Columbia River, where the term was first derived. The reference to  \"a Chinook\" wind or weather system originally meant, to euro-American settlers along the Pacific Northwest coast, a warming wind from the ocean blowing into the interior regions of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.\n\nA strong f\u00f6hn wind can make snow one foot (30\u00a0cm) deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly sublimates and partly melts and evaporates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to as high as 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F) for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest\n\n\"Chinook\" is used for coastal Chinook winds in British Columbia, and is the original use of the term, being rooted in the lore of coastal natives and immigrants, and brought to Alberta by French-speaking fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest.\nThese same winds have more recently been called the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii.\n\nThe air associated with a coastal Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon; most of the region's stormy winds come when a fast \"westerly\" jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash.\n\nWhen a coastal Chinook comes in when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm coastal Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.\n\nThe effects on the Interior of British Columbia when a coastal Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be wrung out of the rising air as a consequence of crossing over the mountain ramparts before the air mass descends (and hence warms and dries) into the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects are similar to those of an Albertan interior Chinook, though not to the same extreme, partly because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and partly because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the coastal Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.\n\nPronunciation in the Pacific Northwest\nThe word \"Chinook\" remains in common use among local fishermen and people in communities along the British Columbia Coast, and coastal Washington and Oregon, and in particular, the term is used in the Puget Sound area of Washington. Coastal \"Chinook\" is not pronounced shin-uk ()  as it is in the interior, east of the Cascades, but is in the original coastal pronunciation chin-uk ().\n\nIn British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest, the word Chinook was predominantly pronounced  . However, the common pronunciation current throughout most of the inland Pacific Northwest, Alberta, and the rest of Canada, is  , as in French. This difference may be because it was the M\u00e9tis employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were familiar with the Chinook people and country, brought the name east of the Cascades and Rockies, along with their own ethnic pronunciation. Early records are clear that tshinook was the original pronunciation, before the word's transmission east of the Rockies.\n\nFirst nations myth from British Columbia",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**The Power of Chinook Winds: Snow Eaters and Temperature Shifters**  \n\nA powerful f\u00f6hn wind, such as the Chinook, can cause a foot (30 cm) of snow to nearly disappear in just one day. The snow vanishes partly through sublimation and partly through melting and evaporation in the dry wind. These winds are known to dramatically raise winter temperatures, sometimes from below \u221220\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to as high as 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F) for several hours or days before temperatures drop back to their usual lows.  \n\n### Origins of the Name \"Chinook\"  \nIn North America\u2019s interior, the Blackfoot people refer to these winds as the \"snow eater.\" However, the more widely used term \"Chinook\" comes from the Chinook people, who lived near the Pacific Ocean along the lower Columbia River. For early Euro-American settlers in the Pacific Northwest, the term originally described a warming ocean wind that blew inland, bringing milder weather to the region.  \n\nIn the western interior of North America\u2014particularly the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains, which lie east of mountain ranges\u2014the same name is used for f\u00f6hn winds. Here, the pronunciation shifts to *'shin-uk.'* While these interior Chinooks share characteristics with their coastal counterparts, they are not always directly linked. Coastal Chinook winds, after losing moisture on the western slopes of mountains, can transform into warm, dry f\u00f6hn winds on the eastern side. However, because the term \"Chinook\" is broadly applied to f\u00f6hn winds in the interior, not all interior Chinooks originate from coastal systems.  \n\n### How Chinook Winds Work  \nThe process begins when warm, moist coastal Chinook winds move inland and rise over mountain ranges. As the air ascends, it cools, releasing moisture as rain or snow on the western slopes\u2014a phenomenon described as the moisture being \"wrung out of the rising air.\" Once the air mass crosses the mountains and descends on the eastern side, it warms and dries due to compression, creating the characteristic warm, dry interior Chinook winds. This mechanism explains why these winds can rapidly melt snow and raise temperatures on the eastern plains.  \n\n### Ecological and Agricultural Effects  \nInterior Chinook winds bring sudden snowmelt and significant temperature spikes, often lifting winter temperatures from below \u221220\u00b0C (\u22124\u00b0F) to 10\u201320\u00b0C (50\u201368\u00b0F) for short periods. A foot of snow can disappear in a day through a combination of sublimation, melting, and evaporation. This rapid snow clearance improves ground accessibility and shortens cold spells, potentially benefiting agriculture by extending growing seasons or allowing earlier planting. However, the document does not specify further ecological or agricultural impacts beyond these immediate effects.  \n\n### Coastal vs. Interior Chinooks: Key Differences  \n1. **Frequency**:  \n   - Coastal Chinooks are \"persistent seasonal\" winds.  \n   - Interior Chinooks are \"occasional.\"  \n\n2. **Duration**:  \n   - Coastal Chinooks bring snowfall and cold spells that typically last only a few days.  \n   - Interior Chinooks raise temperatures for a few hours or days before returning to baseline.  \n\n3. **Intensity**:  \n   - Coastal Chinooks deliver heavy moisture, sustaining temperate rainforests with rain and snow.  \n   - Interior Chinooks are warm, dry f\u00f6hn winds capable of making deep snow vanish rapidly.  \n\n4. **Wind Strength**:  \n   - Coastal Chinooks have stable air, producing \"fresh gales\" in exposed areas but rarely storm-force winds.  \n   - Interior Chinooks are not explicitly described in terms of wind strength, but their f\u00f6hn nature suggests strong warming and drying effects.  \n\nThe document does not provide additional quantitative comparisons between the two types.  \n\nBy understanding these distinctions, we gain insight into how Chinook winds shape weather patterns, ecosystems, and human activities across different regions.",

Lombardo of *Diario de Sevilla* awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, acknowledging its embrace of Argentine stereotypes while praising its ability to strike the perfect balance between bittersweet and melancholic comedy. According to Lombardo, this tonal achievement is due largely to the outstanding performances of its three lead actors.  \n\n**Plot Overview**  \nThe story follows Margarita, who devises a deceptive ploy\u2014pretending to be dead\u2014to lure her former tango partner, Carlos, back to Argentina after forty years. Having built a life in Spain with his own family, Carlos returns, unwittingly embarking on a cross-country journey with Margarita and a mutual acquaintance.  \n\n**Powerhouse Performances**  \nThe film\u2019s emotional core rests on the shoulders of its three protagonists\u2014Dar\u00edo Grandinetti, Mercedes Mor\u00e1n, and Jorge Marrale\u2014whose performances are described as \"overwhelming,\" \"perfectly balanced,\" and \"synchronized.\" Their nuanced portrayals weave together humor and pain, creating a tone that is both tender and biting, softened by moments of dark comedy. Critics have hailed their work as \"unforgettable,\" essential to the film\u2019s ability to blend stereotypes with genuine emotional depth.  \n\n**Themes and Tone**  \nAt its heart, the film explores the theme of return\u2014both physical and emotional\u2014as Carlos revisits his homeland and confronts unresolved history with Margarita. Their road trip across Argentina becomes a metaphor for their shared past, oscillating between laughter and sorrow. The actors\u2019 chemistry elevates the material, making their interactions feel equally humorous and poignant.  \n\n**A Journey Through Emotion**  \nThe film\u2019s bittersweet and melancholic tone emerges from the characters\u2019 complex dynamics. Margarita\u2019s ruse forces Carlos to reconcile his life in Spain with the ghosts of his Argentine past. As noted by Elsa Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos of *El Pa\u00eds*, the road trip serves as a backdrop for their reconnection, highlighting the contrast between Carlos\u2019s present and the lingering emotions of his youth.

    "document": "In hydrology, routing is a technique used to predict the changes in shape of a hydrograph as water moves through a river channel or a reservoir. In flood forecasting, hydrologists may want to know how a short burst of intense rain in an area upstream of a city will change as it reaches the city. Routing can be used to determine whether the pulse of rain reaches the city as a deluge or a trickle.\n\nRouting also can be used to predict the hydrograph shape (and thus lowland flooding potential) subsequent to multiple rainfall events in different sub-catchments of the watershed.  Timing and duration of the rainfall events, as well as factors such as antecedent moisture conditions, overall watershed shape, along with subcatchment-area shapes, land slopes (topography/physiography), geology/hydrogeology (i.e. forests and aquifers can serve as giant sponges that absorb rainfall and slowly release it over subsequent weeks and months), and stream-reach lengths all play a role here.  The result can be an additive effect (i.e. a large flood if each subcatchment's respective hydrograph peak arrives at the watershed mouth at the same point in time, thereby effectively causing a \"stacking\" of the hydrograph peaks), or a more distributed-in-time effect (i.e. a lengthy but relatively modest flood, effectively attenuated in time, as the individual subcatchment peaks arrive at the mouth of the main watershed channel in orderly succession).\n\nOther uses of routing include reservoir and channel design, floodplain studies and watershed simulations.\n\nIf the water flow at a particular point, A, in a stream is measured over time with a flow gauge, this information can be used to create a hydrograph. A short period of intense rain, normally called a flood event, can cause a bulge in the graph, as the increased water travels down the river, reaches the flow gauge at A, and passes along it. If another flow gauge at B, downstream of A is set up, one would expect the graph's bulge (or floodwave) to have the same shape. However, the shape of the river and flow resistance within a river (from the river bed, for example) can affect the shape of the floodwave. Oftentimes, the floodwave will be attenuated (have a reduced peak flow).\n\nRouting techniques can be broadly classified as hydraulic (or distributed) routing, hydrologic (or lumped) routing or semi-distributed routing.  In general, based on the available field data and goals of the project, one of routing procedures is selected.\n\nHydraulic (or distributed) routing\nHydraulic routing is based on the solution of partial differential equations of unsteady open-channel flow. The equations used are the Saint-Venant equations or the associated dynamic wave equations.\n\nThe hydraulic models (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically.\n\nHydrologic (or lumped) routing\nHydrologic routing uses the continuity equation for hydrology. In its simplest form, inflow to the river reach is equal to the outflow of the river reach plus the change of storage:\n\n, where\n\nI is average inflow to the reach during \nO is average outflow from the reach during ; and\nS is the water currently in the reach (known as storage)\n\nThe hydrologic models (e.g. linear and nonlinear Muskingum models) need to estimate hydrologic parameters using recorded data in both upstream and downstream sections of rivers and/or by applying robust optimization techniques to solve the one-dimensional conservation of mass and storage-continuity equation.\n\nSemi-distributed routing\nSemi-distributed models such as Muskingum\u2013Cunge family procedures are also available. Simple physical concepts and common river characteristics such as channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope are used to estimate the  model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions.",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Understanding Hydrological Routing and Modeling Techniques**  \n\nIn hydrological studies, routing is a method used to predict how the shape of a hydrograph changes as water flows through a river channel or reservoir. For instance, in flood forecasting, hydrologists may analyze how a sudden, intense rainfall event upstream will transform by the time it reaches a downstream city. Routing helps determine whether the water arrives as a rapid flood or a gradual flow.  \n\n### Key Variables in Routing  \n- **I**: Average inflow to a river reach during a given period.  \n- **O**: Average outflow from the reach during the same period.  \n- **S**: The water stored within the reach at any time (known as storage).  \n\n### Hydraulic Routing Models: Data and Computational Demands  \nHydraulic models, such as dynamic and diffusion wave models, rely on detailed data about river geometry and morphology to numerically solve flow equations. These models require:  \n1. **River geometry data**, including channel shape and cross-sectional profiles.  \n2. **Morphological data**, such as bed roughness, slope, and reach lengths.  \n\nAccurate data inputs enhance the precision of numerical solutions for equations like the Saint-Venant or dynamic wave equations, which account for flow resistance, channel shape, and floodwave attenuation. However, these models face practical challenges:  \n- Extensive data collection is necessary.  \n- Significant computational resources are required for numerical solutions.  \n\n### Comparing Hydraulic and Hydrological Routing Methods  \nDynamic wave models, a type of hydraulic routing, provide high accuracy due to their detailed physical representation but demand substantial data and computational power. In contrast, simpler hydrological routing methods (e.g., lumped models like the Muskingum method) require minimal data\u2014primarily inflow and outflow records\u2014and rely on parameter estimation techniques. While less computationally intensive, these methods sacrifice some accuracy.  \n\n### The Middle Ground: Semi-Distributed Models  \nSemi-distributed models, such as the Muskingum-Cunge method, strike a balance by incorporating basic physical concepts and common river characteristics (e.g., channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope) without complex numerical computations. Key advantages include:  \n1. **Simplified parameter estimation** using readily available river data.  \n2. **Reduced computational costs** compared to fully distributed models.  \n3. **Operational feasibility** in data-scarce or ungauged basins.  \n\n### How the Muskingum-Cunge Method Works  \nThis approach conserves mass and momentum by leveraging simplified physical principles and common river characteristics. Instead of solving the full Saint-Venant equations, it uses storage-continuity concepts and one-dimensional mass conservation, making it both efficient and adaptable for practical flood forecasting applications.  \n\nBy understanding these modeling trade-offs, hydrologists can select the most appropriate method based on data availability, computational resources, and desired accuracy.",

In flood forecasting, hydrologists may want to know how a short burst of intense rain in an area upstream of a city will change as it reaches the city. Routing can be used to determine whether the pulse of rain reaches the city as a deluge or a trickle.\n\nDynamic wave models require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology, specifically:  \n1. **River geometry** (e.g., channel shape, cross-sectional profiles).  \n2. **Morphology** (e.g., bed roughness, slope, reach lengths).  \n\nThese data inputs influence flood forecasting accuracy by enabling precise numerical solutions of the Saint-Venant equations or dynamic wave equations, which account for flow resistance, channel shape, and other factors affecting floodwave attenuation. More detailed and accurate data improve the model's ability to predict hydrograph changes and flood behavior.\n\nThe practical limitations or challenges faced when gathering and processing river geometry and morphology data for dynamic wave models in real-world flood forecasting scenarios include:\n\n1. The need to gather a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology.\n2. The consumption of significant computer resources to solve the equations numerically. \n\nThese challenges are highlighted in the document under the \"Hydraulic (or distributed) routing\" section.\n\nDynamic wave models (a type of hydraulic routing) require gathering extensive data related to river geometry and morphology and consume significant computational resources to solve the equations numerically. In contrast, simpler hydrological routing methods (e.g., lumped or conceptual models like the Muskingum models) require less data, primarily relying on recorded inflow and outflow data or optimization techniques to estimate parameters. The trade-off is that dynamic wave models offer higher accuracy due to their detailed physical representation, while simpler hydrological methods are more operationally feasible due to lower data and computational demands. Semi-distributed models (e.g., Muskingum\u2013Cunge) strike a balance by using simple physical concepts and common river characteristics without complex numerical solutions.\n\nThe key advantages of using semi-distributed models like Muskingum-Cunge over fully distributed dynamic wave models in flood forecasting are:\n\n1. **Simpler physical concepts and common river characteristics** (e.g., channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope) are used to estimate model parameters.  \n2. **No need for complex and expensive numerical solutions**, reducing computational resource requirements.  \n3. **Balances accuracy and computational efficiency** by avoiding the extensive data gathering and high computational demands of fully distributed models.  \n\nThese advantages make semi-distributed models more practical for certain applications while maintaining sufficient accuracy.\n\nThe Muskingum-Cunge method's reliance on common river characteristics (e.g., channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope) allows it to estimate model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions.

He lost the race to incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan.\n\nEarly life and education\nGross was born in Juneau in 1962. He is the son of former Alaska Attorney General Avrum and Shari Gross, the first Executive Director of the United Fishermen of Alaska, who also founded the League of Women Voters-Alaska. As a child, he was part of the small Jewish community in Alaska, and had the first bar mitzvah in Southeast Alaska. While attending Douglas High School in Juneau, Gross developed an interest in fishing, both sport and commercial. When he was 14, he bought his first commercial fishing boat with a bank loan. He commercially gillnet fished for salmon in the summer to pay his way through college and medical school.\n\nGross attended Douglas High School in Juneau before enrolling at Amherst College, where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in neuroscience. He studied medicine at the University of Washington\u2019s WWAMI Regional Medical Education Program, graduating in 1989.\n\nMedical career\nAfter graduating from medical school, Gross served as the president of the Bartlett Regional Hospital medical staff. In 2006, he founded and served as the president of the Juneau Bone and Joint Center. Gross retired from full-time orthopedic surgery in 2013, but continues to work part time for the Petersburg Medical Center, and volunteers at a training hospital in Cambodia every year.\n\nGross practiced as an orthopedic surgeon in Juneau, beginning in 1994. In 2013, Gross left his practice, along with his wife Monica Gross, to study health care economics, earning a master's of public health at University of California, Los Angeles. He has said that he grew uncomfortable with the high costs of healthcare, and pursued his MPH degree to study solutions.\n\nPolitical career\nAfter earning his MPH, Gross returned to Alaska and began his advocacy for healthcare reform. In 2017, he co-sponsored two ballot initiatives in Alaska. The Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act sought to add certain provisions from the Affordable Care Act into state law, including protection against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and provisions that children could remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. The Healthcare for Alaskans Act would codify the Medicaid expansion, already in effect due to an executive order by Governor Bill Walker. Both initiatives were withdrawn from the ballot in December 2017. Supporters cited uncertainty in healthcare policy at the federal level as the reason for the withdrawal.\n\n2020 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nOn July 2, 2019, Gross announced he would run as an independent in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Alaska. He won the August Democratic primary against Democrat Edgar Blatchford and Independent Chris Cumings, gaining the nomination of the Alaska Democratic Party, which had endorsed him before the filing deadline.\n\nGross ran as an independent against Republican incumbent Senator Dan Sullivan. He had the support of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and The Lincoln Project.\n\nGross said, \"I stepped up to do this because the Alaska economy has been failing, we\u2019ve been losing Alaskans to the Lower 48 for the past few years, and despite that labor loss, we had the highest unemployment in the country.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast argued that Alaska \"flirts with purple-state status\" in part due to Gross's candidacy. There was speculation that the political fallout of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination could dampen support for incumbent Sullivan and benefit Gross's campaign.\n\nMore than a week after the election, Sullivan's reelection in what was expected to be a close race was affirmed.",

He stated, \"I stepped up to do this because the Alaska economy has been failing, we\u2019ve been losing Alaskans to the Lower 48 for the past few years, and despite that labor loss, we had the highest unemployment in the country.\" There is no mention of specific events or experiences beyond these concerns that influenced his decision to run.\n\nThe two ballot initiatives Alan Gross co-sponsored in 2017 were:\n\n1. **The Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act**: It sought to add provisions from the Affordable Care Act into state law, including protection against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and allowing children to remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26.\n\n2. **The Healthcare for Alaskans Act**: It aimed to codify the Medicaid expansion already in effect due to an executive order by Governor Bill Walker. \n\nBoth initiatives were withdrawn from the ballot in December 2017, with supporters citing uncertainty in federal healthcare policy as the reason.\n\nDuring his 2020 U.S. Senate campaign, Alan Gross advocated for healthcare reform policies that included protections against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and provisions allowing children to remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. These policies were part of the Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act, which he co-sponsored in 2017. Additionally, he supported the Healthcare for Alaskans Act, which aimed to codify Medicaid expansion in Alaska. \n\nGross linked these healthcare reforms to Alaska's economic struggles, stating that he ran for office because the Alaska economy was failing, leading to labor loss and the highest unemployment in the country. His advocacy for healthcare reform reflected his broader concern about addressing economic challenges and retaining Alaskans who were leaving for the Lower 48.\n\nAlan Gross's experience as president of the Bartlett Regional Hospital medical staff and founder of the Juneau Bone and Joint Center informed his later advocacy for healthcare reform by making him uncomfortable with the high costs of healthcare, which led him to pursue a master's of public health to study solutions. After earning his MPH, he returned to Alaska and co-sponsored two healthcare reform ballot initiatives in 2017: the Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act and the Healthcare for Alaskans Act. \n\nDuring his 2020 Senate campaign, Gross emphasized his background in healthcare, stating he stepped up to run because of Alaska's failing economy and high unemployment, though the document does not explicitly state whether he directly referenced his leadership roles at Bartlett Regional Hospital or Juneau Bone and Joint Center during the campaign.",

    "document": "Martin Andrew Crimp (born 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent) is a British playwright.\n\nEarly life and career\nThe son of John Crimp, a British Rail signalling engineer, and his wife Jennie, Crimp's family moved in 1960 to Streatham where he attended a local primary school before winning a scholarship to Dulwich College. But when his father was transferred to York, he went to the nearby Pocklington School, where he showed an aptitude for languages, music, English literature, and theatre. He read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1975\u201378), where his first play Clang was staged by fellow student Roger Michell. Before establishing himself as a playwright, he put together An Anatomy, a collection of short stories, and also wrote a novel Still Early Days. These remain unpublished.\n\nHis first six plays were performed at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond. As he told Marsha Hanlon in an interview for the Orange Tree appeal brochure in 1991: \"When the Orange Tree ran a workshop for local writers [in September 1981], I was invited to take part. The carrot was the chance of a lunchtime production, so I wrote Living Remains and the Orange Tree staged it \u2013 my first-ever produced play! I was so excited that I didn't think about the space where it was performed [then a room above a pub], but now I realise that the Orange Tree's intimacy and simplicity provided an extra layer of excitement.\"\n\nSeven of his plays, and his second Ionesco translation have also been presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, where he became writer-in-residence in 1997.\n\nProfessional career\n\nPlaywright \nCrimp\u2019s play Attempts on Her Life, which premiered at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in 1997, was described by critic Aleks Sierz as the \"event that secured his reputation as the most innovative, most exciting, and most exportable playwright of his generation\" [Sierz, Aleks, Aleks, (2013) p.48]. The play presents a unique structure, as none of the lines are assigned to specific characters, and Crimp does not specify the number of actors required to perform the piece. The play consists of seventeen seemingly unrelated scenes in which groups of people provide contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman who is discussed as a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist, and even a new car. Through its deliberate fragmentation, Attempts on Her Life challenges the audience to reconsider their understanding of what constitutes a \"play\" and raises questions about the existence of individuals beyond the constructs we create.\n\nHis other plays range from tragi-comic studies of suburban guilt and repression \u2014 Definitely the Bahamas (1987), Dealing with Clair (1989), The Country (2000) \u2014 via the satirical \u2018entertainment\u2019 In the Republic of Happiness (2012) \u2014 to powerful re-writings of Greek classics \u2014 Cruel & Tender (2004), The Rest Will Be Familiar to You from Cinema (2013). This unusual variety has led Vicky Angelaki to write:\n\nCrimp's work has successfully received numerous productions abroad. In Germany, he is considered to be \"one of the most respected British playwrights\" and it was reported in 2013 that there has been \"more than 60 German-language productions of his work in the past two decades.\"\n\nIn 2021, Crimp was recipient of Germany\u2019s Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize in recognition of the importance of his body of work.\u00a0[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 29 March 2021] Writing about the prize in Theater heute magazine, Till Briegleb praises the way that \u201cWith great authority, Crimp sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible. From the murderer to the child, everyone who appears is unique, their life-lies and fears individual.\u201d\n\nMartin Crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the \"in-yer-face\" school of contemporary British drama, although he rejects the label.\n\nIn 2022, he performed his play Not one of these people, which gave voice to 299 different characters. Supported with a live deepfake video generator, imagined by Quebec director Christian Lapointe, the playwright accepted Lapointe\u2019s invitation to perform as an actor on stage for the first time.\n\nTheatre translator \nFrom 1997 onwards, Crimp has had a parallel career as theatre translator, making his first impact at the Royal Court Theatre with a translation of Ionesco\u2019s The Chairs, a production that subsequently transferred to Broadway. His re-writings of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Misanthrope (1996, revived 2009) and Rostand\u2019s Cyrano de Bergerac (2019/22) were both commercially and critically successful, the latter transferring from London\u2019s West End to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. These rewritings have led some critics to see them as new plays. Angelaki, for example, argues that \"Crimp\u2019s radical adaptations \u2026 depart substantially from the early versions of the texts that inspire them and as such belong to a discussion of Crimp\u2019s playwriting canon, rather than of his translations or versions\" [Angelaki, Vicky, Op. Cit. page 154]",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Martin Crimp: A Playwright of Fragmentation and Critique**  \n\nMartin Andrew Crimp, born on 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent, is a celebrated British playwright. In 2021, he was awarded Germany\u2019s prestigious Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize, a recognition of the profound impact of his body of work. As noted in *S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung* (29 March 2021), critic Till Briegleb, writing in *Theater heute* magazine, lauded Crimp\u2019s ability to \"sketch the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that refuses to acknowledge the violence underpinning its tranquility.\" Briegleb emphasized how Crimp\u2019s characters\u2014from murderers to children\u2014are uniquely drawn, each grappling with personal delusions and fears.  \n\nSeven of Crimp\u2019s plays, along with his second translation of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s works, have been staged at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre, where he served as writer-in-residence in 1997.  \n\n### **Defying Conventions: *Attempts on Her Life***  \nCrimp\u2019s 1997 play *Attempts on Her Life* boldly subverts theatrical norms through its fragmented structure, unassigned dialogue, and contradictory depictions of an unseen protagonist. By refusing a linear narrative or consistent characterizations\u2014presenting the central figure as a terrorist, an artist, a grieving daughter, and even a car\u2014the play compels audiences to interrogate traditional storytelling and the fluidity of identity. This fragmentation mirrors late 1990s anxieties about media distortion and globalization, challenging viewers to question how societal narratives shape and destabilize meaning.  \n\n### **Later Works: Experimentation Within Form**  \nWhile *Attempts on Her Life* dismantles narrative coherence entirely, Crimp\u2019s subsequent plays retain some structural familiarity while still pushing boundaries:  \n- ***The Country*** (2000): A tragi-comic exploration of suburban guilt and repression, this play adheres to a more conventional storyline but delves into psychological tension and moral ambiguity.  \n- ***In the Republic of Happiness*** (2012): A satirical, episodic work divided into sections such as \"The Destruction of the Family,\" it blends song, direct address, and absurdity to critique modern bourgeois values\u2014though less radically fragmented than *Attempts on Her Life*.  \n\n### **Themes and Critical Reception**  \nThe Nyssen-Bansemer prize underscores Crimp\u2019s enduring examination of bourgeois society and its hidden violences, a thread running through works like *Attempts on Her Life* and *In the Republic of Happiness*. Briegleb\u2019s praise highlights Crimp\u2019s knack for exposing the contradictions of privileged existence, a theme evident in his destabilization of identity and societal norms.  \n\n*Attempts on Her Life* remains a landmark in experimental drama, its unassigned lines and disjointed scenes redefining theatrical engagement. By rejecting fixed roles and linearity, Crimp invites audiences to actively construct meaning, influencing contemporary theater\u2019s embrace of ambiguity and participatory storytelling.  \n\nThrough his career, Crimp has consistently challenged conventions, whether by deconstructing narrative entirely or weaving fragmentation into more structured forms.

    "document": "London Central Bus Company Limited, trading as Go-Ahead London, is a bus company operating in South London. The London Central brand is a subsidiary of Go-Ahead London and operates services under contract to Transport for London.\n\nHistory\n\nLondon Central commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units. In September 1994, it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group for \u00a323.8\u00a0million. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nGarages\nLondon Central operates five bus garages.\n\nBexleyheath (BX)\nAs at January 2023, Bexleyheath garage operated routes 51, 89, 132, 244, 321 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 486, 624, 625, 658, B11, B12, B13 and B16.\n\nHistory\nBuilt as a trolleybus depot by the London Passenger Transport Board, Bexleyheath was the only new garage built for trolleybuses. The depot is a large and imposing building, slightly set back from the main road to enable parking on the forecourt, which was used as a terminus for route 122. Bexleyheath closed in 1986, with work transferred to Catford, Plumstead and Sidcup garages.\n\nIn 1988 it re-opened under the guise of Bexleybus, a low-cost unit set up by London Buses under de-regulation, and had a large and varied allocation from Iveco/Robin Hoods and MCW Metroriders to Leyland Olympians and Daimler Fleetlines. The move to set up the new company to tender for routes backfired, and in the next round of tendering only route B16 was awarded to Bexleybus, whilst London Central won nine.\n\nLondon Central took control of Bexleyheath garage and routes in 1990. Lately the garage has had a good utilisation figure, up to 139 in 2001 which necessitated parking in the rear yard and the forecourt. In January 2007, the garage received its first Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for use on route 486.\n\nThis garage also houses one of the companies iBus hubs, controlling routes for Bexleyheath, Morden Wharf, New Cross, and Peckham garages.\n\nIn 2022, Bexleyheath became the first bus garage in London to be equipped for 'opportunity charge' electric bus operation, whereby the bus is charged while terminating before starting its next journey. This was introduced on route 132 whose eastern terminus is at the garage. A gantry was installed at the garage connecting with a pantograph on the top of the bus. On 9 July 2022, a fleet of Alexander Dennis Enviro400EVs began to enter service on the route.\n\nCamberwell (Q)\nAs at September 2023, Camberwell garage operated routes 1, 12, 35, 40, 42, 100, 108D, 176, 185, 355, 360, 484, N1, N15 (additional workings only) and SL6. On 30 April 2016, route 345 passed to Abellio London. On 2 May 2020, route P5 passed to Abellio London with new Caetano e.City Gold Buses.\n\nHistory\nAlthough built in 1914, Camberwell garage was not used as a bus garage until 1919 as it had been requisitioned for the war effort. Once it came into use it was one of London's largest garages and also carried out body overhauls in 1940/41.

    "document": "Airg\u00edalla (Modern Irish: Oirialla, English: Oriel, Latin: Ergallia) was a medieval Irish over-kingdom and the collective name for the confederation of tribes that formed it. The confederation consisted of nine minor kingdoms, all independent of each other but paying nominal suzerainty to an overking, usually from the most powerful dynasty. Airg\u00edalla at its peak roughly matched the modern dioceses of Armagh and Clogher, spanning parts of counties Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. Its main towns were Armagh and Clogher. The name's usage survives as a cultural area of folk tradition in South East Ulster and adjoining areas of County Louth.\n\nAccording to legend, Airg\u00edalla was founded by the Three Collas, who are said to have conquered what is now central Ulster from the Ulaid. The decisive victory was the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, said to have been fought around the year 331. However, this tale is thought to be mostly fiction, and the actual year and circumstances of how the Airg\u00edalla confederation came about is unknown.\n\nOriginally thought to have been under the dominance of the neighbouring Ulaid to the east, the territory of the Airg\u00edalla from the 6th century onwards was gradually eroded by the encroachment of their northern neighbours, the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, as well as the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to their south. From 735 they fell under the dominance of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, and by 827 had become their vassals. The kingdom of Airg\u00edalla was at its peak in the 12th century, under king Donnchad Ua Cerbaill. The later constricted kingdom of Airg\u00edalla survived in Monaghan\u2014which was known as Oirghialla and Oriel after the Norman Invasion of Ireland\u2014under the Mac Mathghamhna, until the end of the Gaelic order in Ireland.\n\nEtymology\nAirg\u00edalla may mean \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers\", and refers to both the Irish over-kingdom of Airg\u00edalla, and the confederation of tribes that formed it. It is commonly Anglicised as Oriel; however, archaic Angliciations include: Uriel, Orial, Orgialla, Orgiall, Oryallia, and Ergallia.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Norman invasion, the Anglicisation \"Uriel\" became the name of the part of Airg\u00edalla that had extended into modern-day County Louth. Similarly, the portion of Airg\u00edalla that survived in modern-day County Monaghan, became known as Oirghialla, from which derives the Anglicisation \"Oriel\".\n\nIn early manuscripts the Bishop of Clogher was styled Bishop of Oirialla.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to legend\nIn the beginning of the 4th century, three warlike brothers, known as the Three Collas, made a conquest of a great part of Ulster, which they wrested from the Ulaid. It was the after the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, fought around 331, that they founded Airg\u00edalla. In this battle the forces of the Three Collas defeated the forces of Fergus Foga, king of Ulster, who was slain, and the victors burned to the ground Emain Macha, the ancient capital of Ulaid.\n \nHowever, in general it can be shown that the origin legend was written (or composed) in the second quarter of the 8th century to seal their alliance with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\nHistorical emergence\nThe earliest reference to the Airg\u00edalla occurs in the Annals of Tigernach under the year 677, where the death of Dunchad mac Ultan, \"R\u00ed Oigriall\", is noted. However, it is suspected of being a retrospective interpolation. On the other hand, the entry in the Annals of Ulster under the year 697 which lists Mael Fothataig mac Mael Dub as \"Rex na nAirgialla\" may indeed be genuine. Both Mael Fothatag and his son, Eochu Lemnae (died 704), are listed among the guarantors of the \"C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in\" in 697. Thus it is believed that the Airg\u00edalla were probably in existence as an entity by then, or certainly by the opening years of the 8th century.\n\n8th\u201312th centuries\n\n13th\u201316th centuries",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "### The Airg\u00edalla: History and Origins  \n\n#### Etymology  \nThe term *Airg\u00edalla* is believed to derive from an Irish phrase meaning \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers.\" It refers both to the over-kingdom of Airg\u00edalla and the tribal confederation that constituted it. While commonly Anglicized as *Oriel*, older variations include *Uriel*, *Orial*, *Orgialla*, *Orgiall*, *Oryallia*, and *Ergallia*.  \n\n#### Origins and Early History  \nThe exact origins of the Airg\u00edalla confederation remain uncertain. According to legend, it was established by the Three Collas following their triumph at the Battle of Achadh Leithdheirg around 331 AD. However, this account is widely regarded as mythical. The earliest credible historical records mentioning the Airg\u00edalla appear in the late 7th century, specifically in the *Annals of Tigernach* (677) and the *Annals of Ulster* (697). These references suggest the confederation was already in existence by this period or, at the latest, the early 8th century. Scholars believe the origin legend was crafted in the 8th century to strengthen an alliance with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, leaving the true circumstances of its formation unclear.  \n\nAt its height, the Airg\u00edalla confederation covered a region approximating the modern dioceses of Armagh and Clogher, encompassing parts of present-day counties Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, Fermanagh, Tyrone, and Londonderry. Its principal settlements were Armagh and Clogher.  \n\n#### Political Context and Decline  \nInitially, the Airg\u00edalla territory was thought to be under the control of the neighboring Ulaid to the east. However, from the 6th century onward, its lands were gradually diminished by the expansion of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain (a branch of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill) from the north and the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill from the south. By 735, the Airg\u00edalla had succumbed to the dominance of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, becoming their vassals by 827.  \n\nAs a result, the confederation\u2019s core territory was wedged between these powerful neighboring kingdoms: the Ulaid to the east, the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to the north, and the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to the south.  \n\n#### Religious and Political Significance  \nEarly manuscripts refer to the Bishop of Clogher as the \"Bishop of Oirialla,\" a title that underscores the ecclesiastical and political importance of Clogher within the Airg\u00edalla confederation. As one of the confederation\u2019s main towns, Clogher served as a key religious center, and the bishop\u2019s authority extended over the spiritual affairs of the region. This connection highlights the intertwined nature of religious and political structures in the Airg\u00edalla, demonstrating how the church played a central role in its governance.  \n\nBy preserving the original facts while refining the structure and clarity, this version enhances readability without introducing new information.",

    "document": "A cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. The term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejeculation outside the receiver's body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. Facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.\n\nThe term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \"couples erotica\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in \"girl-girl\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.\n\nCum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely.\n\nTerminology\nA cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot.\n\nOriginally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.\n\nOrigin and features\n\nAlthough earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature\u2014displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film Behind the Green Door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as \"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\". Steven Ziplow's The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography (1977) states:\n\nCum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene.\n\nAs a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.\n\nHealth risks\n\nTransmission of disease\nAny sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" or OPIM.\n\nAside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**The Evolution and Health Risks of the \"Money Shot\" in Film and Pornography**  \n\nOriginally, the term *money shot* in general filmmaking referred to the most expensive scene in a production\u2014often a high-cost special effects sequence intended to serve as a major selling point for the film. For instance, in an action thriller, an elaborate explosion might be labeled the movie\u2019s \"money shot.\" However, the term took on a different meaning in pornography, where it came to denote scenes of ejaculation, reportedly because male performers were paid extra for such footage. Over time, the film and TV industry borrowed this usage back from pornography, applying it to highly emotional, visually dramatic moments\u2014such as intense reactions on talk shows.  \n\n### **Cum Shots in Pornography**  \nA *cum shot* specifically depicts human ejaculation, typically in pornographic films, photos, or magazines. Unlike real-life sexual encounters, these shots usually involve external ejaculation onto another person, ensuring visibility for the viewer. Common variations include *facials* (ejaculation onto the face) or shots onto other body parts, such as the chest, genitals, or tongue. These scenes often serve as a climactic conclusion in pornographic sequences.  \n\n### **Health Risks**  \nCum shots and facials carry potential health risks, primarily related to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Semen can harbor infections like HIV and hepatitis, posing a higher risk if it contacts broken skin or mucous membranes (e.g., eyes, lips, or mouth). While the receiving partner faces these risks, the ejaculating partner is at minimal risk of contracting an STD from the act. Notably, the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration classifies semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" (OPIM).  \n\n### **Historical and Cultural Significance**  \nThe prominence of cum shots in pornography grew significantly with the rise of hardcore films in the 1970s, becoming a standard feature that emphasized visible ejaculation.

This artistic approach cemented the cum shot as a defining element of hardcore pornography, often used to conclude scenes with maximum visual impact.  \n\nIndustry practices, such as paying male actors extra for these scenes (reinforcing the term *money shot*), along with cultural factors, contributed to their prevalence. For example, actresses in the 1960s and 70s often distrusted birth control, leading to a preference for external ejaculation, as noted by scholar Joseph Slade. Cum shots also became central to niche fetish genres like bukkake. In contrast, softcore pornography and couples' erotica typically avoided explicit depictions to comply with regulations or cater to less graphic preferences.  \n\nUltimately, the *money shot*\u2014whether in mainstream cinema or adult films\u2014reflects both commercial priorities and evolving stylistic conventions in visual storytelling.",

    "document": "The third government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n was the Government of Hungary between 6 June 2014 and 18 May 2018. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n formed his third cabinet after his party-alliance, Fidesz and its coalition partner, Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) altogether won a qualified majority in the 2014 parliamentary election.\n\nPolicy\n\nImmigration\n\nDuring the 2015 European migrant crisis the government initiated the erection of the Hungary-Serbia barrier to block entry of illegal immigrants. Just like the other Visegr\u00e1d Group leaders, the government was against any compulsory EU long-term quota on redistribution of migrants.\n\nOn 24 February 2016 the prime minister announced that the government would hold a Referendum on whether to accept the European Union's proposed mandatory quotas for relocating migrants. He also said it is \"no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas\" and that they will be campaigning for \"no\" votes. Orb\u00e1n argued that the quota system would \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do\". On 5 May, after examining the legal challenges, the Supreme Court (K\u00faria) allowed the holding of the referendum.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the no vote won with 3,362,224 votes or 98.36% of the total number of votes.\n\nFree Sunday\nFidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary) has supported the restriction on Sunday shopping (\"free Sunday\", as they called) for a long time, citing Christian values. Parliament voted on the issue on December 14, 2014 and the law came into effect on March 15, 2015 (a Sunday on which shops would have been closed anyway, the day being a public holiday in Hungary). Public opinion was predominantly against the decision. Three polls done in the spring of 2015 registered an opposition of 64% (Szonda Ipsos), 62% (Medi\u00e1n) 59% (T\u00e1rki). By the end of May, according to a poll by Medi\u00e1n, 72% of those polled disliked the new law, even the majority of Fidesz-KDNP voters were against it. Opposition parties and private persons tried to start a public referendum several times. By November 2015 there were 16 such attempts, but none of them were approved, for various bureaucratic reasons, until in early 2016 one of these attempts, initiated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, was finally successful. The government, rather than being forced to hold the referendum (which could have been interpreted as a huge success for the opposition party, even though the law was opposed by the majority of Fidesz voters too) lifted the ban in April 2016.\n\nNGO Law\nOn 13 June 2017, The Hungarian Parliament Passed a Law Targeting Foreign-Funded NGOs. The law requires civil groups receiving foreign donations above a certain threshold to register as organizations funded from abroad. The law was passed 130 to 44, with 25 abstaining.\n\nParty breakdown\n\nBeginning of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the beginning of term:\n\nEnd of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the end of term:\n\nMembers of the Cabinet",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Hungary\u2019s Overwhelming Rejection of EU Migrant Quotas**  \n\nIn the autumn of that year, Hungary held a referendum on whether to accept the European Union\u2019s proposed mandatory quotas for relocating migrants. The result was decisive: the \"no\" vote won with 3,362,224 votes, representing 98.36% of the total ballots cast.  \n\n### Government Stance and Campaign  \nThe Hungarian government, under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, strongly opposed the EU\u2019s migrant relocation quotas. Orb\u00e1n argued that the quota system threatened to \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural, and religious identity,\" asserting that no EU institution had the authority to impose such changes. The government actively campaigned for a \"no\" vote, framing the referendum as a defense of national sovereignty and identity.  \n\n### Legal Approval and Referendum Outcome  \nThe referendum proceeded after Hungary\u2019s Supreme Court (K\u00faria) dismissed legal challenges, allowing the vote to take place. The overwhelming \"no\" victory\u2014with 98.36% support\u2014provided a clear expression of public opposition to the EU\u2019s migration policy.  \n\n### Key Argument Against the Quotas  \nThe central argument presented by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government was that the EU\u2019s mandatory quotas would forcibly alter the demographic and cultural fabric of Hungary and Europe. The document highlights this reasoning as the primary justification for the referendum, though it does not elaborate on additional legal or constitutional grounds.  \n\nThe referendum\u2019s outcome reinforced the Hungarian government\u2019s stance, solidifying its resistance to EU-mandated migrant redistribution policies.",

The no vote won with 3,362,224 votes or 98.36% of the total number of votes.\n\nThe Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, opposed the EU's proposed mandatory quotas for relocating migrants, arguing that the quota system would \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do.\" Orb\u00e1n explicitly stated that the government would campaign for \"no\" votes in the referendum, emphasizing their refusal of migrant quotas. The referendum was held after the Supreme Court allowed it, and the \"no\" vote won overwhelmingly with 98.36% of the votes.\n\nThe Supreme Court's (K\u00faria) decision to allow the holding of the referendum on EU migration quotas legally permitted the government to proceed with the referendum, overcoming any prior legal challenges. This enabled the government to formally gauge public opinion on the issue, as evidenced by the subsequent vote in autumn where the \"no\" vote won with 98.36% of the votes.\n\nThe document states that Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n argued the EU quota system would \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do.\" This was the primary argument presented to justify holding the referendum on EU migration quotas. No further legal or constitutional arguments are detailed in the document.",

    "document": "Terry Wolverton (born 1954) is an American novelist, memoirist, poet, and editor. Her book Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman's Building, a memoir published in 2002 by City Lights Books, was named one of the \"Best Books of 2002\" by the Los Angeles Times, and was the winner of the 2003 Publishing Triangle Judy Grahn Award, and a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award. Her novel-in-poems Embers was a finalist for the PEN USA Litfest Poetry Award and the Lambda Literary Award.\n\nEarly years \nBorn August 23, 1954, in Cocoa Beach, Florida, Wolverton grew up in Detroit, Michigan.  \nHer grandmother, Elsba Mae Miller, a former English teacher, would often read and recite poetry to her, and Wolverton credits this for inspiring her love of language.  Even as a child Wolverton was interested in the arts, especially writing, music, and drama; she graduated from the Performing Arts curriculum of Cass Technical High School in 1972.\n\nEducation \nWolverton graduated from the Performing Arts curriculum of Cass Technical High School in 1972, after which she attended the University of Detroit as a student in its Bachelor of Fine Arts Theatre program.  In 1973, she transferred to the University of Toronto, majoring in Theatre, Psychology, and Women's Studies. In 1975, Wolverton participated in Sagaris, an independent institute for the study of feminist political theory. She ultimately received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in Creative Writing and Theater from Thomas Jefferson College, an experimental school based at Grand Valley State Colleges in Western Michigan, where she participated in its feminist Women, World, and Wonder program.\n\nWolverton also received a certificate from the Feminist Studio Workshop in Los Angeles and is a certified Kundalini yoga and meditation instructor.\n\nCareer \nWolverton moved to Los Angeles in 1976, enrolling in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building.  She spent the next thirteen years at the Woman's Building where, in addition to writing and performing, she was also instrumental in the Lesbian Art Project, the Incest Awareness Project, the Great American Lesbian Art Show (GALAS), a year-long performance project called \"An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism\", and a White Women's Anti-Racism Consciousness-Raising Group.  From 1987 to 1988, she served as the nonprofit organization's Executive Director.\n\nWolverton has taught performance skills and creative writing since 1977.  In 1986, she developed the Visions and Revisions Writing Program at Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres.  In 1988, she launched the Perspectives Writing Program at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, where she taught until 1997. One notable writer that attended these workshops was Gil Cuadros, a Mexican American poet who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. Cuadros started attending her writing workshops for people with HIV. As a result of his participation, Cuadros published his collection of poetry and fiction, City of God(1994).\n\nIn 1997, Wolverton founded Writers at Work, a creative writing center where she continues to teach fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, and to provide creative consultations to writers.\n\nIn 2007, Wolverton co-founded The Future of Publishing Think Tank, which convened writers, publishers, booksellers and publicists to consider new models for reaching readers. The Think Tank held discussions, offered workshops, conducted reader surveys, and compiled an online directory of literary resources in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe same year, she became an affiliate faculty member in the Master of Fine Arts writing program at Antioch University, where she currently works.\n\nAwards\n\nBibliography \nAuthor\nBlack Slip, Clothespin Fever Press, 1992,  (poetry) \nBailey's Beads, Faber & Faber, 1996,  (novel)\nMystery Bruise, Red Hen Press, 1999,  (poetry)\nInsurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman's Building, City Lights Books, 2002.

    "document": "The Pembrokeshire Militia, later the Royal Pembroke Rifles, was an auxiliary regiment reorganised from earlier precursor units in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire during the 18th Century. Primarily intended for home defence, it served in Britain and Ireland through all Britain's major wars. It was converted into garrison artillery in 1853 and continued until it was disbanded in 1909.\n\nPembroke Trained Bands\n\nThe universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and   was extended to Wales. King Henry VIII called a 'Great Muster' in 1539, which showed the following available in the newly reorganised county of Pembrokeshire:\n County of Pembrokeshire: 1166 men available for service, of whom 139 had 'harness' (armour)\n Lordship of Haverfordwest: 454 (43 with harness)\n Tenants of Thomas Jones in both those places and in the Hundred of Dewisland: 380 with 4 'nags' (horses)\n Cilgerran Hundred: 254\n\nThe legal basis of the militia was updated by two Acts of 1557 covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. The county militia was now under the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by the Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace (JPs). The entry into force of these Acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised Militia of England and Wales. Although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the Trained Bands, who were mustered for regular training. During the Armada crisis of 1588 Pembrokeshire furnished 800 trained foot and 30 'petronel's (the petronel was an early cavalry firearm).\n\nIn the 16th Century little distinction was made between the militia and the troops levied by the counties for overseas expeditions. However, the counties usually conscripted the unemployed and criminals rather than send the trained bandsmen. Between 1585 and 1602 Pembrokeshire supplied 610 men for service in Ireland and 30 for the Netherlands. The levies were commanded by professional captains rather than local men: in 1601 a captain who had raised 100 troops in Gloucestershire was ordered to take the 50 from Pembrokeshire under his  command as well. The men were given 'conduct money' to get to the embarkation ports. This was recovered from the government, but replacing the weapons issued to the levies from the militia armouries was a heavy cost on the counties.\n\nWith the passing of the threat of invasion, the trained bands declined in the early 17th Century. Later, King Charles I attempted to reform them into a national force or 'Perfect Militia' answering to the king rather than local control. The Pembrokeshire Trained Bands of 1638 consisted of 557 men, 276 armed with muskets and 281 'Corslets' (body armour, signifying pikemen). They also mustered 57 horse. Part of this force may have been organised as the North Pembroke Trained Band. Pembrokeshire was ordered to send 300 men overland to Newcastle upon Tyne for the Second Bishops' War of 1640. However, substitution was rife and many of those sent on this unpopular service would have been untrained replacements.\n\nCivil Wars\nControl of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between Charles I and Parliament that led to the English Civil War. When open war broke out between the King and Parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. Most of Wales was under Royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the King's armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby leaning towards Parliament. These were vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. On 18 September 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the Earl of Carbery as the King's Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire TBs to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament.\n\nOnce Parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed new Militia Acts that replaced lords lieutenant with county commissioners appointed by Parliament or the Council of State. At the same time the term 'Trained Band' began to disappear in most counties. Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the New Model Army to control the country. By 1651 the militias of the South Welsh counties appear to have been combined, with the 'South Wales Militia' being ordered to rendezvous at Gloucester to hold the city during the Worcester campaign.\n\nPembrokeshire Militia\nAfter the Restoration of the Monarchy, the Militia was re-established by the The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661 under the control of the king's lords lieutenant, the men to be selected by ballot. This was popularly seen as the 'Constitutional Force' to counterbalance a 'Standing Army' tainted by association with the New Model Army that had supported Cromwell's military dictatorship.\n\nThe militia forces in the Welsh counties were small, and were grouped together under the direction of the Lord President of the Council of Wales. As Lord President, the Duke of Beaufort carried out a tour of inspection of the Welsh militia in 1684. On 11 August, when he inspected the Pembrokeshire Militia near Haverfordwest, it consisted of a regiment of foot ('all of firelocks', ie musketeers with no pikemen) and one Troop of horse. The 1697 militia returns showed the foot as 456 strong under Colonel Sir Thomas Stepney, 5th Baronet, High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, organised in seven companies (one commanded by the Mayor of Pembroke), and the troop of 36 horse under Captain Arthur Owen, MP for Pembrokeshire.\n\nGenerally the militia declined in the long peace after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Jacobites were numerous amongst the Welsh Militia, but they did not show their hands during the Risings of 1715 and 1745, and bloodshed was avoided.\n\n1757 reforms",

When open war broke out between the King and Parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. Most of Wales was under Royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the King's armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby leaning towards Parliament. These were vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. On 18 September 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the Earl of Carbery as the King's Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire TBs to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament.\n\n1757 reforms\n\nDuring the Earl of Carbery's campaign to secure Pembroke and Tenby for the Royalists in 1643, the Pembrokeshire Trained Bands were summoned to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament. \n\nAnswer: The Pembrokeshire Trained Bands were summoned to Haverfordwest, declared for the King, and were presumably absorbed into the Royalist army during the Earl of Carbery's campaign in 1643.\n\nIn 1643, during the Civil Wars, Haverfordwest served as the gathering point where the Pembrokeshire Trained Bands declared for the King under the Earl of Carbery, the King's Lieutenant-General for the region. This action was part of the Royalist campaign to secure control over Pembrokeshire, particularly the Parliamentarian-leaning towns of Pembroke and Tenby, which were vital for Royalist supply lines from Ireland. The Trained Bands were presumably absorbed into the Royalist army after their declaration at Haverfordwest. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recaptured by Parliamentarian forces under Rowland Laugharne.\n\nPembroke and Tenby were strategically vital for Royalist supply lines from Ireland during the Civil Wars because they were coastal towns that allowed the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. Their control was essential for maintaining these supply lines. \n\nAnswer: Pembroke and Tenby were coastal towns vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland.\n\nAt the time they were summoned to Haverfordwest in 1643, the Pembrokeshire Trained Bands consisted of 557 men, with 276 armed with muskets and 281 as pikemen (referred to as 'Corslets'). They also mustered 57 horse. Part of this force may have been organized as the North Pembroke Trained Band. \n\nWhen summoned by the Earl of Carbery, the Trained Bands declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. This bolstered Royalist forces in the region, aiding their campaign to secure Pembroke and Tenby, which were vital for receiving supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. However, these towns were later recaptured by Parliamentary forces under Rowland Laugharne. \n\nTheir composition (a mix of musketeers, pikemen, and cavalry) made them a flexible force, but their absorption into the Royalist army suggests they were used to supplement professional troops rather than operate independently.",
    "reconstructed document from partial obs": "**The Pembroke Trained Bands and Their Role in the English Civil War**  \n\nControl over the militia was a key point of contention between King Charles I and Parliament, contributing to the outbreak of the English Civil War.

Instead of a desktop environment it used a customized implementation of the Openbox window manager. Many of its preinstalled applications used the GTK+ widget toolkit.\n\nCrunchBang had its own software repository but drew the vast majority of packages from Debian's repositories.\n\nPhilip Newborough announced on 6 February 2015 that he had stopped developing CrunchBang and that users would benefit from using vanilla Debian. Some Linux distributions have arisen in its place in an effort to continue its environment. Among the most significant are BunsenLabs and CrunchBang++.\n\nEditions \nCrunchBang Linux provided an Openbox version for i686, i486 and amd64 architectures. Until October 2010 there also was a \"Lite\" version  with fewer installed applications. The \"Lite\" version was effectively discontinued after the distribution on which it was based \u2013 Ubuntu 9.04 \u2013 reached its end-of-life and CrunchBang prepared to switch to a different base system.\n\nCrunchBang 10, made available in February 2011, was the first version based on Debian. The final version, CrunchBang 11, was made available on 6 May 2013.\n\nEach CrunchBang Linux release was given a version number as well as a code name, using names of Muppet Show characters. The first letter of the code name was the first letter of the upstream Debian release (previously Debian Squeeze and CrunchBang Statler and currently Debian Wheezy and CrunchBang Waldorf).\n\nReception\nIn May 2013 Jim Lynch of desktoplinuxreviews.com reviewed CrunchBang 11:\n\nSuccessors \nNewborough announced in February 2015 that he was abandoning further development of CrunchBang Linux, feeling that it no longer served a purpose.

However, many users disagreed with this decision and took it upon themselves to develop successor projects, including BunsenLabs, CrunchBang++ (#!++), and CrunchBang-Monara, ensuring the continuation of the lightweight, efficient computing environment that CrunchBang had provided.  \n\n#### Editions of CrunchBang Linux  \n\nCrunchBang Linux originally offered an Openbox-based version compatible with i686, i486, and amd64 architectures. Additionally, a \"Lite\" edition\u2014featuring fewer preinstalled applications\u2014was available until October 2010.

Based on Debian 10 (Buster), its primary goal was to preserve the original CrunchBang experience while adapting to modern needs. Designed to remain lightweight, BunsenLabs supports 32-bit systems through a CD edition, making it suitable for older hardware with as little as 1 GB of RAM. It includes the X Window System and an up-to-date version of Firefox, ensuring usability without compromising efficiency.  \n\n#### The Transition from CrunchBang to BunsenLabs  \n\nFollowing Newborough\u2019s announcement, the CrunchBang community actively worked to sustain the project\u2019s legacy. Notably, between September 17 and 30, 2015, CrunchBang\u2019s domain began redirecting to BunsenLabs, symbolizing the shift to community-led development. BunsenLabs, as a Debian-based successor, maintained compatibility with older systems, offering a seamless transition for users who still valued CrunchBang\u2019s minimalistic approach. While the document does not elaborate on specific collaborative efforts beyond this, it highlights the community\u2019s dedication to keeping the project alive.  \n\nIn summary, though CrunchBang Linux was officially discontinued, its spirit endured through successor distributions like BunsenLabs, which upheld its principles of simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility for low-resource systems.",

    "document": "Greek lyric is the body of lyric poetry written in dialects of Ancient Greek.\nIt is primarily associated with the early 7th to the early 5th centuries BC, sometimes called the \"Lyric Age of Greece\", but continued to be written into the Hellenistic and Imperial periods.\n\nBackground\n\nLyric is one of three broad categories of poetry in classical antiquity, along with drama and epic, according to the scheme of the \"natural forms of poetry\" developed by Goethe in the early nineteenth century. (Drama is considered a form of poetry here because both tragedy and comedy were written in verse in ancient Greece.) Culturally, Greek lyric is the product of the political, social and intellectual milieu of the Greek polis (\"city-state\").\n\nMuch of Greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. The symposium (\"drinking party\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed. \"Lyric\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithara) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). Whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the Greek word for \"song\" melos). Lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. This latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking.\n\nModern surveys of \"Greek lyric\" often include relatively short poems composed for similar purposes or circumstances that were not strictly \"song lyrics\" in the modern sense, such as elegies and iambics. The Greeks themselves did not include elegies nor iambus within melic poetry, since they had different metres and different musical instruments. The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome offers the following clarification: \"'melic' is a musical definition, 'elegy' is a metrical definition, whereas 'iambus' refers to a genre and its characteristics subject matter. (...) The fact that these categories are artificial and potentially misleading should prompt us to approach Greek lyric poetry with an open mind, without preconceptions about what 'type' of poetry we are reading.\"\n\nGreek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Partheneia, \"maiden-songs,\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals. Love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. In this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet, excelled. The themes of Greek lyric include \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" and hetero- and homosexual love.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, the encyclopedic movement at Alexandria produced a canon of the nine melic poets: Alcaeus, Alcman, Anacreon, Bacchylides, Ibycus, Pindar, Sappho, Simonides, and Stesichorus. Only a small sampling of lyric poetry from Archaic Greece, the period when it first flourished, survives. For example, the poems of Sappho are said to have filled nine papyrus rolls in the Library of Alexandria, with the first book alone containing more than 1,300 lines of verse. Today, only one of Sappho's poems exists intact, with fragments from other sources that would scarcely fill a chapbook.\n\nMeters\n\nGreek poetry meters are based on patterns of long and short syllables (in contrast to English verse, which is determined by stress), and lyric poetry is characterized by a great variety of metrical forms. Apart from the shift between long and short syllables, stress must be considered when reading Greek poetry. The interplay between the metric \"shifts\", the stressed syllables and caesuras is an integral part of the poetry. It allows the poet to stress certain words and shape the meaning of the poem.\n\nThere are two main divisions within the meters of ancient Greek poetry: lyric and non-lyric meters. \"Lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. The lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. Some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of Sappho and Alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of Pindar.\"\n\nThe lyric meters' families are the Ionic, the Aeolic (based on the choriamb, which can generate varied kinds of verse, such as the glyconian or the Sapphic stanza), and the Dactylo-epitrite. The Doric choral songs were composed in complex triadic forms of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, with the first two parts of the triad having the same metrical pattern, and the epode a different form.\n\nBibliography",

They served a specific social or cultural function in celebrating and commemorating the role of young women in religious and communal events. Unlike other forms of choral lyric poetry such as hymns (devotional songs to gods) or paeans (songs of praise or triumph, often for Apollo), partheneia were uniquely focused on the participation and expression of maiden choruses in festival settings.

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**The Rich Tapestry of Greek Lyric Poetry**  \n\nGreek lyric poetry encompassed a wide array of themes and functions, from celebrating athletic victories (*epinikia*) and honoring the dead to inspiring soldiers, expressing devotion to the gods, and exploring love in its many forms. These poems took shape as hymns, paeans, dithyrambs, and *partheneia*\u2014\"maiden-songs\" performed by choruses of young women at festivals. Love poetry ranged from adoration and longing to seduction and bitter reproach, sometimes blurring into invective, a sharp poetic attack perfected by Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet. The subject matter of these works was vast, touching on politics, war, sports, drinking, wealth, youth, aging, death, mythology, and both heterosexual and homosexual love.  \n\n### **Meter and Performance**  \nGreek poetry was divided into two primary metrical categories: lyric and non-lyric. Lyric meters, originally sung to the lyre, were less regular than their non-lyric counterparts, featuring varied line lengths and mixed metrical feet. Some lyric meters were suited to monody (solo performance), as seen in the works of Sappho and Alcaeus, while others were designed for choral performance, such as the choruses in tragedies or Pindar\u2019s victory odes.  \n\nMuch of Greek lyric poetry was occasional, composed for specific public or private events. The symposium, or drinking party, was a common venue for such performances. Lyric poetry could be accompanied by string instruments like the lyre or *kithara*, or by wind instruments such as the *aulos* (a reed pipe). This accompanied form was known as *melic* poetry (from the Greek *melos*, meaning \"song\"). Alternatively, lyric poetry could be recited without music, a style referred to simply as *meter*.  \n\n### **Forms and Functions**  \n- **Partheneia**: Sung by maiden choruses at festivals, these songs celebrated the role of young women in religious and communal life. Unlike hymns (devotional songs) or paeans (songs of praise, often for Apollo), *partheneia* were uniquely tied to maiden performances.  \n- **Monodic Lyric**: Performed solo, as in the works of Sappho and Alcaeus, this form often explored personal emotions\u2014love, desire, or even invective\u2014and was typically intended for intimate settings like symposia.  \n- **Choral Lyric**: Designed for group performance, this included *epinikia* (victory odes) and tragic choruses, which celebrated public achievements or religious events.  \n\n### **Instrumentation and Delivery**  \nThe choice of accompaniment\u2014or its absence\u2014reflected the poem\u2019s purpose:  \n1. **Melic Poetry**: Sung with lyre or *aulos* accompaniment, enhancing its musicality for symposia or festivals.  \n2. **Meter**: Recited without music, emphasizing the spoken word.  \n3. **Monody**: Typically accompanied by the lyre, underscoring its personal, introspective nature.  \n4. **Choral Lyric**: Often paired with the *aulos*, suited to the grandeur of group performances.  \n\n### **Commemorative vs. Celebratory Poetry**  \n- **Poems for the Dead**: These honored the deceased with themes of loss and memory, adopting a somber, reflective tone to evoke grief and preserve legacy.  \n- **Victory Odes (*Epinikia*)**: These exalted athletic triumphs, linking victors to heroic myths in a jubilant, prideful tone meant to inspire communal pride.  \n\n### **Invective and Social Commentary**  \nInvective poetry, exemplified by Archilochus, served as a weapon of mockery or shaming, starkly contrasting with love poetry\u2019s tender or plaintive tones. While love poetry sought admiration or sympathy, invective aimed to provoke or humiliate its targets.  \n\n### **Public vs. Private Contexts**  \n- **Exhortatory Poetry**: Meant to rally soldiers, it was performed publicly to bolster morale.  \n- **Sympotic Poetry**: Composed for drinking parties, it entertained small groups with themes of love, politics, or revelry.  \n\n### **Professional vs. Personal Composition**  \nPoets like Pindar and Simonides worked on commission, crafting formal pieces for public events under patronage. In contrast, Sappho and Archilochus produced more personal, spontaneous works, often for private audiences. The former celebrated communal achievements, while the latter delved into individual emotions and experiences.  \n\nThrough its diverse forms and functions, Greek lyric poetry captured the breadth of human experience, from the deeply personal to the grandly communal, leaving a legacy that continues to resonate.",

The Eveleigh Railway Workshops, adjacent to the site, had a major locomotive depot for the storage and servicing of running steam locomotives. For such depots, it was normal practice to have a nearby \"barracks\" building to accommodate staff between shifts.\n\nIt replaced an earlier barrack which had been close to the running shed in the locomotive yard at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, and had been requested by a proposed extension of the workshops. The Brandling Street site was selected due to its closeness to the workshops while being in a quiet neighbourhood. It was built at a cost of \u00a32000.\n\nThe new accommodation was a large two-storey building of an expanded domestic design with 13 principal rooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a 6ft. verandah on three sides. The dining area was occasionally used as a conference room.\n\nThe building was used by the State Rail Authority's fire protection services during the 1980s and 1990s. It is now used as a private residence. It remains little altered from its original appearance and layout.\n\nDescription\n\nThe former Enginemans Resthouse is a two-storey Edwardian mansion on a quiet street featuring single or double storey late Victorian or Federation dwellings.\n\nThe building is of Federation/ Edwardian style. It is surrounded by gardens and has verandas on three sides, paved with flagstones. The corridors runs in the middle of the house at both floor levels. The middle entrance is flanked with 2 windows on the ground level and 5 windows are displayed at the first level. All external walls are rendered and painted and the hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron roofing.\n\nHeritage listing\n\nEnginemans Resthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is the largest of the few surviving railway barracks buildings in the State.\n\nSee also",

    "reconstructed document from exploration": "**Enginemans Resthouse: A Glimpse into Railway Heritage**  \n\n**History and Significance**  \n\nEnginemans Resthouse, located at 39 Brandling Street in Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia, is a heritage-listed building originally constructed between 1902 and 1903 as accommodation for railway workers. Once serving as a dormitory for train drivers, firemen, and guards stationed near the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, it later became a private residence after being utilized by the State Rail Authority\u2019s fire protection services in the 1980s and 1990s. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  \n\n**Architectural Features**  \n\nDesigned as a functional yet spacious railway workers' cottage, the Enginemans Resthouse retains much of its original structure. The two-storey building features 13 principal rooms, a kitchen, a dining area (which occasionally doubled as a conference room), and a six-foot verandah wrapping around three sides. Its layout includes central corridors on both floors, while its Federation/Edwardian architectural style is evident in the rendered exterior walls, corrugated iron roofing, and flagstone-paved verandas. According to historical records, the building has undergone minimal alterations, preserving its authentic appearance and design.  \n\n**Connection to the Eveleigh Railway Workshops**  \n\nThe Resthouse\u2019s location was strategically chosen for its proximity to the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, a major depot for steam locomotive storage and maintenance. This made it a convenient lodging option for workers between shifts. It replaced an earlier barrack situated near the workshops\u2019 locomotive yard, which was demolished due to planned expansions. The Brandling Street site was selected specifically for its balance of accessibility to the workshops and its tranquil residential setting.  \n\n**Living Conditions**  \n\nDuring its operational years, the Resthouse provided basic yet functional living quarters for railway staff. The spacious two-storey structure accommodated workers with its 13 principal rooms, kitchen, dining area, and verandahs. However, no documented accounts or personal anecdotes from workers about their experiences at the Resthouse have been preserved.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \n\nToday, the Enginemans Resthouse stands as a well-preserved relic of New South Wales\u2019 railway history. Its architectural integrity and historical significance offer insight into the living and working conditions of early 20th-century railway employees, while its transition to a private residence ensures its continued preservation.",
